Docker is the easiest way to get started with self-hosted Supabase.

## Before you begin

You need the following installed in your system:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and docker-compose
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Getting started

### Get the code

Checkout the docker directory in the Supabase repo:

```sh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/supabase/supabase
cd supabase/docker
```

### Manage Secrets

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and populate the values.

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

In particular, these are required:

- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: the password for the `postgres` role 
- `JWT_SECRET`: used by PostgREST and GoTrue, among others
- `SITE_URL`: the base URL of your site
- `SMTP_*`: mail server credentials

### Generate API Keys

Use your `JWT_SECRET` to generate a `anon` and `service` API keys using the [JWT generator](/docs/guides/hosting/overview#api-keys).

Replace the values in these files:

- `docker-compose.yml`: 
  - `ANON_KEY` - replace with an `anon` key
  - `SERVICE_KEY` - replace with a `service` key
- `volumes/kong.yml`
  - `anon` - replace with an `anon` key
  - `service_role` - replace with a `service` key

### Start 

You can now start Supabase:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

Your database will be persisted in `volumes/db/data`, and your storage objects in `volumes/storage`. 

Try out the examples in `supabase/examples` to verify if it works correctly!


## Configuration

To keep the setup simple, we made some choices that may not be optimal for production:

- the database is in the same machine as the servers
- the storage uses the filesystem backend instead of S3

We strongly [recommend](/docs/guides/hosting/overview#managing-your-database) that you decouple your database
before deploying.
Each system can be [configured](/docs/guides/hosting/overview#configuration) to suit your particular use-case.

## Deploying

See the following guides to deploy Docker Compose setup using your preferred tool and platform:

- [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/stack-deploy/)
- [AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/deploy-applications-on-amazon-ecs-using-docker-compose/)
- [Using Kompose for Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/translate-compose-kubernetes/)
