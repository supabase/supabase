In Postgres, data is stored in "tables". 
Tables are similar to excel spreadsheets. They contain columns & rows of data. There are a few key differences from a spreadsheet however:

- Every column is a strict type of data. When you set up a column, you must define the "data type".
- Tables can be "joined" together. For example you can have a `users` table, which is joined to a `teams` table (because users belong to teams).

For example, this table has 3 "columns" (`id`, `name`, `description`) and 4 "rows" of data:

| `id`    | `name` | `description` |
| ----  | ---- | ----------- |
|    1 | Toy Story | When a new toy called "Forky" joins Woody and the gang, a road trip alongside old and new friends reveals how big the world can be for a toy. |
|    2 | Monsters, Inc. | In order to power the city, monsters have to scare children so that they scream. However, the children are toxic to monsters. |
|    3 | Finding Nemo | After his son is captured in the Great Barrier Reef and taken to Sydney, a timid clownfish sets out on a journey to bring him home. |
|    4 | WALL-E | In the distant future, a small waste-collecting robot inadvertently embarks on a space journey that will ultimately decide the fate of mankind. |


## Creating Tables

Supabase provides several options for creating tables. You can use the Table Editor or create them directly using SQL. 
We provide a SQL editor within the Dashboard, or you can [connect](/docs/guides/database/connecting/connecting-to-postgres) to your database 
and run the SQL queries yourself.


<Tabs
defaultActiveId="UI"
values={[
  {label: 'UI', value: 'UI'},
  {label: 'SQL', value: 'SQL'},
]}>
<TabsPanel id="UI" label="UI">

```sh
1. Go to the "Table editor" section.
2. Click "New Table".
3. Enter the table name "todos".
4. Click "Save".
5. Click "New Column".
6. Enter the column name "task" and make the type "text".
7. Click "Save".
```

</TabsPanel>
<TabsPanel id="SQL" label="SQL">

```sql
-- Create a table called "todos" with a column to store tasks.

create table todos (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  task text check (char_length(task) > 3)
);
```

</TabsPanel>
</Tabs>


### Tips

- It is best practice to use lowercase and underscores when naming tables. For example: `table_name`, not `Table Name`.
- Tables belong to `schemas`. If you don't explicitly pass the schema, Postgres will assume that you want to create the table in the `public` schema.


### Data types

Every column is a predefined type. PostgreSQL provides many [default types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype.html), and you can even design your own (or use extensions) 
if the default types don't fit your needs.
