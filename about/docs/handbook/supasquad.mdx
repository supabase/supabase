## FAQs

    <i>Why are you only admitting 20 new members?</i>
  </summary>
  The entire Supabase team is only 20 people, so as you can imagine adding another 20 people sounds like
  a lot to us! We wish we could admit everyone who wanted to join. But we also want to make sure everyone
  who joins the Squad has an awesome experience. In the future we will probably expand the intake to
  include a monthly quota.

  ways match your skillset.

    <i>What if I become too busy to contribute?</i>

  No worries! The program isn't a job. It's just an opportunity to build your skillset and audience within
  the Supabase ecosystem.
