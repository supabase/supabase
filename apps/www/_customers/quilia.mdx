Quilia is a startup that empowers personal injury clients to take control of their case data, streamlining the process of aggregating and sharing critical information with their attorneys. Our primary product is an app that allows clients to securely store and manage various aspects of their case, including treatment details, accident information, vehicle damage, wage loss, and more.

By providing a centralized platform for clients to input and access their case data, Quilia simplifies the information gathering process for attorneys, enabling them to build stronger cases and achieve better outcomes for their clients.

**The Challenge**

Prior to discovering Supabase, Quilia's infrastructure was built on Render and multiple servers with complex, hard-to-manage scripting. We had also developed a custom API that required significant maintenance. This setup made it challenging for most of our team to make changes to the site, often having to wait for API updates before completing otherwise simple tasks.

While the monetary cost was around $100 per month, we were spending a considerable amount of time on tasks that are now straightforward with Supabase. Our primary goal was to increase our release speed by improving accessibility for our team and reducing the time spent on infrastructure management.

Additionally, as a startup handling sensitive client data, we needed a solution that could provide robust security features and easy scalability to accommodate our growing user base.

**Why Supabase?**

Our new CTO, Lucho Suárez, introduced us to Supabase, and we were immediately impressed by its native API. As we delved deeper into Supabase's features, we realized it could solve many of our challenges.

Supabase's user-friendly interface and comprehensive documentation made it easy for our team to get started. The built-in authentication system and row-level security features were critical for ensuring the security of our clients' data. Additionally, the potential for future AI integration aligned with our long-term vision for the product.
