[Firecrawl](http://firecrawl.dev/) provides a chat-powered search engine for technical documentation. Their AI-powered search tool makes it easier for developers and other technical users to find relevant information in complex documentation. Users can simply ask questions in natural language, and the tool returns the most relevant answers. Firecrawl's search engine also provides detailed analytics, which helps teams identify knowledge gaps and areas for improvement in their documentation. Firecrawl has integrated with some of the largest open source projects in the space such as LangChain and LlamaIndex.

## The Challenge

Firecrawl was experiencing tremendous success, growing Weekly Active Users by nearly 300% since March. They needed a tool to store and search through large amounts of vector data to improve the efficiency and accuracy of their similarity search operations. They tried Faiss, Weaviate, and Pinecone, but found them to be expensive and not very intuitive, especially when it came to storing metadata along with the vectors.

## Why they chose Supabase

Firecrawl lear that Supabase supports [pgvector](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/extensions/pgvector) and found it to be a simple and cost-effective solution. They were impressed with the open source nature of Supabase, as well as its ability to store metadata alongside the vectors. They also appreciated the intuitive interface and ease of use.

  We tried other vector databases - we tried Faiss, we tried Weaviate, we tried Pinecone. We found
  them to be incredibly expensive and not very intuitive. If you're just doing vector search they're
  great, but if you need to store a bunch of metadata that becomes a huge pain.

## What They Built

Using [Supabase Vector](https://supabase.com/vector), Firecrawl was able to build a more efficient and accurate search function for their AI chatbot. By storing vector data alongside metadata in Supabase, Firecrawl was able to quickly and easily search through their customers documentation to find the most relevant responses to queries. They found that Supabase's solution was just as performant as dedicated vector databases, but without the high cost.

  We looked at the alternatives and chose Supabase because it's open source, it's simpler, and, for
  all the ways we need to use it, Supabase has been just as performant - if not more performant -
  than the other vector databases.
