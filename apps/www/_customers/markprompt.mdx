  We’ve found that having access to the full features of Postgres, colocated with the embeddings,

## The Challenge

When developing the platform, Markprompt considered GDPR compliance crucial as it enabled them to handle user data responsibly, maintain data privacy, and foster trust and confidence among their customers. As a result, the choice of a robust vector database and authentication solution became vital in ensuring adherence to GDPR requirements.

Markprompt has successfully indexed over half a million sections of content, with a steady influx of 10,000 - 50,000 new sections daily. This emphasizes the significance of [Supabase Vector](https://supabase.com/vector) in terms of reliability and scalability.

## What They Built

Markprompt is a set of API endpoints that allow you to train your content and create a prompt to ask questions to it, for instance for a docs site. Markprompt also designed a user-friendly web dashboard that simplifies content training, synchronization with GitHub repos or websites, access key management, and provides insights into user query statistics. Furthermore, Markprompt's UI components, available as React and Web Components, allow the integration of prompts at all touch points of a company, from public websites to internal knowledge bases with just a few lines of code.

Like Supabase, Markprompt is an open-source platform, allowing customers the freedom to host the dashboard and model backend on their own premises.
