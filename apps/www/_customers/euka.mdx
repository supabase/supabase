  Supabase gave us the tools we needed to move fast, scale quickly, and stay flexible as we grow —
  all without the heavy lifting.

Euka is reimagining how brands scale their presence on social media. Their AI-powered platform helps businesses find, manage, and scale creator partnerships, primarily on TikTok Shop. By automating the most time-consuming parts of user-generated content (UGC) campaigns, Euka allows brands to build awareness and drive sales faster than ever before.

As they expanded beyond ecommerce into SaaS and consumer software, Euka needed a backend platform that could scale with them without slowing them down.

## The challenge

Euka’s vision required a backend that could support rapid iteration, structured data analytics, seamless AI integration, and scalable storage. To succeed, Euka needed:

- A relational database that supported structured queries.
- Integrated services like authentication, storage, and AI search.
- A platform that scaled easily as their business grew.
- A developer-first experience to enable faster shipping.

## Choosing Supabase

When it came time to choose a permanent foundation for the business, Kevin recalled a side project where Supabase had impressed him with its simplicity and speed. This time, for Euka, it was not just about familiarity. It was about finding the right platform to unlock their next phase of growth.

Supabase provided everything they needed in one place:

- A fully managed Postgres database with standard SQL support.
- Built-in authentication, storage, edge functions, and vector search.
- Native AI features like pgvector for semantic search.
- An intuitive dashboard and first-class developer experience.

  It just worked. Supabase gave us a zero-to-one experience that let us build quickly without
  worrying about the backend.

Supabase allowed the team to move faster without compromising on performance or scalability. It also future-proofed their stack for AI development without needing costly rewrites later.

## How Euka built with Supabase

Euka’s architecture focuses on simplicity and rapid iteration. They designed their system to get the most out of Supabase while maintaining flexibility for future growth.

Their stack includes:

- **Frontend**: Two Next.js apps deployed on Vercel, one for brands and one for creators.
- **Backend**: Python scripts for data scraping, trend analysis, and creator search, connected directly to Supabase.
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage for managing creator profile pictures, videos, and ecommerce product images.
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with ongoing fine-tuning around OAuth flows.
- **AI search**: Supabase’s `pgvector` extension for trending video discovery, using cosine similarity searches.

  Setting up the database and storage was one of the easiest parts of building our MVP.

Supabase’s dashboard also became a powerful internal tool. Engineers could debug quickly by inspecting real-time logs and queries. Non-technical teams like marketing and sales used the dashboard to run simple queries, inspect user data, and export reports without needing custom-built admin panels.

## The results

Since launching on Supabase, Euka has accelerated every part of their development lifecycle. They can build quickly and are able to deliver new AI capabilities faster than expected.

Supabase helped Euka achieve:

- Faster developer cycles by standardizing on SQL.
- Easier scaling through integrated, high-performance services.
- Simplified AI expansion using `pgvector` and seamless embedding storage.
- Greater internal collaboration through an intuitive, accessible dashboard.

Supabase gave Euka a faster way to ship, a stronger foundation for AI growth, and a platform that can evolve alongside them as they expand into new industries.
