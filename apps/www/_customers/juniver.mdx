  For me, the biggest benefit of Supabase is developer experience. My expertise doesn't lie in
  databases and infrastructure. It really didn't take much time at all to spin up this product with
  Supabase.

[Juniver](https://www.joinjuniver.com/) is an iOS app that guides people through recovery from eating disorders and disordered eating. The product combines an AI recovery coach, a thoroughly researched curriculum, and self-serve tools designed for moments of need. Juniver is expanding from B2C into B2B2C, licensing its platform to clinics and clinicians who then offer it to patients.

## The challenge

Juniver needed to evolve its backend to support a new B2B2C product, without risking the stability of its consumer app.

- Launch a self-serve, automated, scalable platform for clinics and clinicians
- Enforce strict privacy and access controls across clinics, clinicians, patients, and licenses
- Integrate tightly with Stripe and webhooks to automate onboarding and license provisioning
- Move quickly with a lean team, choosing tools that won't have to be replaced in a few years

They also faced significant friction with their previous Firebase setup:

- Document-based storage made data relationships difficult to manage
- Manual relationship handling slowed development
- Limited scalability for complex B2B requirements
- Developer productivity was constrained by Firebase's limitations

  Time is such a big currency in startup world. With Firebase, we were really struggling with
  relationships within our data. It was all done very manually, as you can expect with
  document-based storage. Supabase is a relational database and it's much easier and we can move
  faster.

## Choosing Supabase

Juniver had long run on Google Cloud with Firebase for the mobile app. The new B2B product created a clean slate to evaluate alternatives and set a foundation for future scale. Supabase offered a relational core (Postgres) and an integrated developer experience that aligned with Juniver's needs now and later.

**Why Supabase**

- A relational database (Postgres) to model clean, maintainable relationships
- Integrated developer experience: visual Table Editor with inline SQL, clear logs, SDKs
- Strong security posture with Row Level Security, plus an easy way to "view as user" to validate policies
- Built-in primitives (Auth, Functions) to save time and build with best-of-breed products

<Quote img="nick-farrant-juniver.jpg" caption="Nick Farrant, Founding Engineer, Juniver">
  The Supabase developer experience is so clear. I've got everything at my fingertips. I'm in the
  Table Editor. The SQL editor is literally right below the table editor. The feature you have to
  see the table from a different user's perspective to test your Row Level Security is a wonderful
  little feature that I use all the time.

## The approach

Juniver used the B2B product as a greenfield build on Supabase, avoiding risky dependencies on the legacy Firebase data while preparing for an eventual B2C migration.

- **Getting started**
  - Spun up a new Supabase project and schema for clinics, clinicians, patients, and licenses
  - Leaned on documentation and the iOS SDK to accelerate the build
- **Implementation highlights**
  - **Database (Postgres):** Relational schema with strict Row Level Security; frequent use of "view as user" to validate policies
  - **Auth & OAuth:** Managing identities for clinics and patients with fine-grained access
  - **Webhooks + Edge Functions:** Stripe purchase triggers an automated sequence to authenticate partners, provision license codes, and send emails
  - **Operational visibility:** Edge Function logs and an integrated console for fast debugging and iteration

  You have to expect, plan, and build for scale. We can scale exponentially with Supabase.

## The results

Juniver's B2B platform is out in the wild and early in adoption, but the team is already seeing meaningful wins in developer experience and delivery speed.

- Rapidly build-out of a self-serve, automated B2B platform using out-of-the-box Supabase features
- Faster iteration through an integrated UI, inline SQL, clear logs, and RLS policy testing
- A relational foundation that supports today's B2B needs and tomorrow's B2C migration
- Streamlined development process with Supabase's integrated tooling

  My advice to developers thinking of moving to Supabase: Try it, it's free. Replicate your project.
  You'll see how much easier it is to think about your data from a relational point of view.
