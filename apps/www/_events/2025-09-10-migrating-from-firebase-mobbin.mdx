## Firebase to Postgres: Breaking through the NoSQL ceiling

Firebase is great for MVPs, but most teams hit the ceiling fast. When your app starts to scale, Firestore’s NoSQL model can slow you down, limit your queries, and drive up costs without warning.

In this 45-minute session, Supabase engineers and Mobbin CEO Liau Jian Jie break down the technical challenges of growing on Firebase and show how Postgres gives you the tools to scale with confidence. You’ll learn how to migrate your app to Supabase on AWS using modern SQL, real-time features, and flexible auth and storage, all with better performance and cost control.

This session is built for startup founders and technical leads who want to stay fast without giving up control.

### Key takeaways

- What breaks when Firebase apps start to scale
- How SQL makes complex queries simple
- How to migrate data, auth, and storage in a weekend
- Why Postgres improves speed and observability
- What it really costs to stay on Firebase
- Lessons from a founder who already made the switch
