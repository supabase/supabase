## Cutting Costs and Scaling with Confidence

Managed Auth providers like Auth0 or Firebase Auth can simplify the implementation and management of authentication, but costs can explode once an application’s usage scales up. Join us as we learn about Supabase Auth and Row Level Security from Supabase Auth engineer, Stojan Dimitrovski, about how Supabase can deliver an easy to use, hosted, portable, and affordable Auth solution for your application’s authentication and security.

Jakob Steinn, Co-founder & Tech Lead at [Good Tape](https://goodtape.io), will discuss how his company evolved from a corporate innovation concept to providing fast, secure, and accurate audio and video transcription for millions of journalists worldwide. Joined by Kevin Brolly, Head of Customer Success at Supabase, they’ll share insights into the challenges of rapid scaling and how their teams worked together to execute a seamless migration from Auth0.

### Key Takeaways:

- Learn how Supabase Auth, combined with Row Level Security, delivers an easy to implement, portable, and affordable solution for application authentication and security.
- Hear a testimonial from Good Tape on the factors which led them to migrate as well as the cost and operational benefits after making the switch to Supabase Auth.
