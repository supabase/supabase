description: >-
  Apply neuroscience-inspired optimization techniques to your existing PyTorch models in this 
  innovative hackathon. Based on recent discoveries about biological dendrites performing additional 
  computation, participants will integrate artificial dendrites into their PyTorch projects using 
  Perforated AI's open source repository. Compete for prizes up to $3,000 plus W&B pro memberships 
  in the Case Studies track, or earn $500 bonuses through the Hackathon Inception track. 
  Bring your existing functional PyTorch project—this is an enhancement competition, not a build-from-scratch event.
