## Stop Competing on Speed

AI tools like Lovable, Bolt, Cursor, and Claude can help anyone build an MVP in a week.

That speed used to be your edge. Now it’s the baseline.

The difference between a fast build and a successful product is the foundation it’s built on.

Supabase provides that foundation. Giving agencies the flexibility, scalability, and security they need to turn rapid prototypes into reliable, production-grade applications.

In this 45-minute session, three agencies running 40%+ margins share how they combine AI development tech with Supabase to move beyond speed and deliver long-term client value. You’ll learn how to position technical depth, data architecture, and product strategy as the differentiators clients actually pay for.

### What You'll Learn

- Services founders buy after the MVP
- Turning Postgres and data architecture into premium retainers
- The maturity narrative that helps justify higher pricing
- How to qualify clients who care about quality, not cost
- Building recurring revenue through ongoing optimization
