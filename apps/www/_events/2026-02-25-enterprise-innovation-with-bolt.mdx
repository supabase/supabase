Something strange is happening in large enterprises. Non-technical employees are building production software. CEOs are shipping features. And companies are canceling SaaS contracts worth millions.

In this webinar, you will learn how enterprise innovation teams are using AI coding tools like Bolt to build real applications on Supabase. We will show you how to rapidly prototype internal tools, how to work within the constraints of an existing design system, and how to empower non/semi-technical teams to build safely.

## Key Takeaways

- How to give non-technical teams the ability to build production software without compromising security or stability

- The governance model that makes AI-assisted development safe for enterprises

- Why prototypes built on the right foundation can go to production without being rebuilt

- How to evaluate SaaS contracts differently when building becomes cheaper than buying

- Real-world use cases for rapidly prototyping and building internal tools

- The MCP integration that connects AI coding tools directly to your database

Join us live to participate in the Q&A. Can't make it? We'll send you a link to the recording.
