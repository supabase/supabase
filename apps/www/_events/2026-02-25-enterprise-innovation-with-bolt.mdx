## Something Strange is Happening in Large Enterprises

Non-technical employees are building production software. CEOs are shipping features. And companies are canceling SaaS contracts worth millions.

In this webinar, you will learn how enterprise innovation teams are using AI coding tools like Bolt to build real applications on Supabase. We will show you how one publicly traded company empowered over 100 non-technical employees to ship production software, replaced expensive vendor contracts across 20+ countries, and created a new model where business teams and engineering work together in ways that were not possible a year ago.

### What You'll Learn

- How to give non-technical teams the ability to build production software without compromising security or stability

- The governance model that makes AI-assisted development safe for enterprises

- Why prototypes built on the right foundation can go to production without being rebuilt

- How to evaluate SaaS contracts differently when building becomes cheaper than buying

- The MCP integration that connects AI coding tools directly to your database

This session is for CIOs, CTOs, Chief Innovation Officers, VP Engineering, and enterprise architects who want to understand what is actually working in AI-assisted development today.

If you tried AI coding tools before and walked away unimpressed, try again. We'll show you how.
