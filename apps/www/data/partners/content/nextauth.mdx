Open Source Authentication for Next.js.

#### NOTE

This adapter is developed by the community and not officially maintained or supported by Supabase. It uses the Supabase Database to store user and session data in a separate `next_auth` schema. It is a standalone Auth server that does not interface with Supabase Auth and therefore provides a different feature set.

If you’re looking for an officially maintained Auth server with additional features like [built-in email server](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-email#configure-email-settings?utm_source=next-auth-docs&medium=referral&campaign=next-auth), [phone auth](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-twilio?utm_source=next-auth-docs&medium=referral&campaign=next-auth), and [Multi Factor Authentication (MFA / 2FA)](https://supabase.com/contact/mfa?utm_source=next-auth-docs&medium=referral&campaign=next-auth), please use [Supabase Auth](https://supabase.com/auth) with the [Auth Helpers for Next.js](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-helpers/nextjs?utm_source=next-auth-docs&medium=referral&campaign=next-auth).

#### Easy
