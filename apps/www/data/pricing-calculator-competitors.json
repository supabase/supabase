Assumption for 100,000 MAUs: tiered (marginal) pricing above the no-cost tier, so billed MAUs = 100,000 - 50,000 = 50,000 at $0.0055 = $275. Excludes SMS/phone and MFA per-message charges (region-dependent) and excludes Tier 2 providers (SAML/OIDC) which are billed separately ($0.015 per MAU beyond 50). Firestore note: Firestore is not priced per MAU; it is billed by reads/writes/deletes/storage and varies heavily with workload.
