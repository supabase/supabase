### Multi-factor Authentication

Supabase allows users to enable Multi-factor authentication (MFA) on their account.
MFA adds an additional layer of security to your user account, by requiring a second factor to verify your user identity.

### SOC 2

Supabase is SOC2 Type 2 compliant. This is an important security policy when handling sensitive customer data.

Enterprise and Team customers can access our SOC2 report [on the dashboard](/dashboard/org/_/documents).

### HIPAA

Supabase is HIPAA compliant. You can store Protected Health Information (PHI) on our hosted platform once you enter into a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with us and fulfill your HIPAA obligations under our [shared responsibility model](/docs/guides/platform/shared-responsibility-model#managing-healthcare-data).

Enterprise and Team customers can request to sign our BAA [on the dashboard](/dashboard/org/_/documents).

### Data Encryption

All customer data is encrypted at rest with AES-256 and in transit via TLS.

Sensitive information like access tokens and keys are encrypted at the application level before they are stored in the database.

### Backups

All paid customer databases are backed up every day.

Point in Time Recovery allows restoring the database to any point in time. Customers from the Pro Plan have access to this feature as an add-on.

### Payment processing

Stripe is a certifiedÂ PCI Service Provider Level 1, which is the highest level of certification in the payments industry.

### Vulnerability Management

Supabase works with industry experts to conduct regular penetration tests.

In addition to internal security reviews, we use various tools to scan our code for vulnerabilities including [GitHub](https://github.com), [Vanta](https://www.vanta.com/), and [Snyk](https://snyk.io/).

### DDoS Protection

Supabase combats Distributed Denial of Service attacks in several ways to mitigate resource abuse and prevent runaway bills.

In addition to protection at the CDN level via Cloudflare, we employ [fail2ban](https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban) to prevent brute force logins. Users can [customize rate limits](/docs/guides/platform/going-into-prod#rate-limiting-resource-allocation--abuse-prevention) for critical API routes and set [spend caps](/docs/guides/platform/spend-cap) to prevent surprise bills.
