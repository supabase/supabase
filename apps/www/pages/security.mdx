### Vulnerability Management

Supabase works with industry experts to conduct regular penetration tests.

In addition to internal security reviews, we use various tools to scan our code for vulnerabilities including [GitHub](https://github.com), [Vanta](https://www.vanta.com/), and [Snyk](https://snyk.io/).

### DDoS Protection

Supabase combats Distributed Denial of Service attacks in several ways to mitigate resource abuse and prevent runaway bills.

In addition to protection at the CDN level via Cloudflare, we employ [fail2ban](https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban) to prevent brute force logins. Users can [customize rate limits](/docs/guides/platform/going-into-prod#rate-limiting-resource-allocation--abuse-prevention) for critical API routes and set [spend caps](/docs/guides/platform/spend-cap) to prevent surprise bills.
