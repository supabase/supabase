# Service Level Agreements

## Enterprise Platform Uptime SLA

The following Service Level Agreement, which is incorporated into and forms part of the Subscription Agreement between Supabase, Inc. ("Supabase") and Customer (the "Agreement"), will apply to the Services for Enterprise Customers specified in an Order Form during the applicable Subscription Term.

---

## 1. Definitions

All capitalized terms used but not defined in this SLA have the meaning set forth in the Agreement.

**Availability Metrics:**

Defines the measurements used to calculate service uptime under this SLA.

- **Scheduled Availability:**

  The total time (in minutes) that the applicable service is generally accessible and available to permitted users.

- **Scheduled Downtime/Maintenance Windows:**

  Periods of time that Supabase has communicated in advance, during which the service may be temporarily unavailable due to planned maintenance, upgrades, or other scheduled activities. These windows are not counted as Unscheduled Downtime for SLA purposes.

- **Unscheduled Downtime:**

  The total time (in minutes) that the service is not accessible or available, excluding periods attributable to any causes listed under SLA Exclusions.

- **Actual Availability:**

  The result of subtracting Unscheduled Downtime from Scheduled Availability.

**Release Maturity Levels:** Indicates the stage of release for a given product or feature and whether it is covered by the SLA.

- **GA (General Availability):** The product is fully released and covered by the SLA.
- **Beta:** The product or feature is in limited release. Beta products are not covered by the SLA.
- **Alpha:** The product or feature is in early release. Alpha products are not covered by the SLA.

For the current release stage of each Supabase product and feature see [Supabase features](https://supabase.com/features).

**SLA Scope:** The level at which service availability is measured and the impact required to constitute an SLA breach.

- **Global:** The service is deployed from a centralized global infrastructure; SLA is breached if more than 1% of projects worldwide are affected during a downtime event.
- **Regional:** The service is deployed within individual geographic regions; SLA is breached if more than 1% of projects in a single region are affected.
- **Project:** The service is deployed on a dedicated, per-project basis; SLA applies individually to each project.

---

## 2. Uptime Commitment

Supabase will provide Actual Availability for at least ninety-nine and nine tenths percent (99.9%) of the total time in each calendar month during the Subscription Term, as measured by Supabase (the "Uptime Commitment"). Each product is individually covered by a 99.9% uptime commitment for customers with an Enterprise tier subscription.

---

## 3. SLA Definition & Exclusions

  Issues attributable to external vendors or cloud providers, including AWS, Cloudflare, GCP, Azure, GitHub, or other similar providers.

- **Integration Partners:**

  Failures or downtime related to third-party integration partners, such as Resend for email delivery, or other external service failures.

- **General Factors Outside Our Control:**

  Events such as force majeure, internet service provider (ISP) outages, or other issues outside Supabase's reasonable control.

- **Customer Actions or Inactions:**

  Resource limitations, misconfigurations, or failures to follow operational guidelines provided in Supabase documentation; delays in recovery due to insufficient I/O capacity; issues caused by customer's equipment or software; or account suspension or termination in accordance with Supabase Terms.

where Credit Percentage is derived from the table below:

| Actual Availability                                | Credit Percentage |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Less than 99.9% but greater than or equal to 99.0% | 10%               |
| Less than 99.0% but greater than or equal to 98.0% | 15%               |

## 5. Credit Requests and Payment

To request a Service Credit, Customer must send an email to Supabase at support@supabase.io within thirty (30) days of the end of the month in which the Uptime Commitment was not met. The request must include:

(a) the affected organization, service(s), region(s), and project(s);

(b) the specific dates and times (in 5-minute intervals) during which the service was unavailable; and

(c) supporting logs or monitoring data showing failed requests or clear unavailability.

Supabase reserves the right to validate any claim using its own internal monitoring systems and may deny claims that are unsupported, inaccurate, or inconsistent with internal metrics.

If Supabase confirms that Customer is eligible for a Service Credit, Supabase will issue a credit to Customer's account within thirty (30) days. Service Credits are not refunds, cannot be exchanged into cash, and may only be applied to future billing charges. Except as set forth in Section 6 below, the Service Credits constitute Customer's sole and exclusive remedy, and Supabase's sole and exclusive liability, for any failure to meet the Uptime Commitment.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this SLA, the total amount of Service Credits issued to Customer under this SLA shall not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the total fees paid by Customer for the affected services under the applicable Order Form during the preceding twelve (12) month period. Any Service Credits calculated in excess of this cap will be forfeited and shall have no cash or credit value.
