## 3. Customer Responsibilities.

### a. General

Customer is responsible and liable for all uses of the Services and Documentation resulting from access provided by Customer, directly or indirectly, whether such access or use is permitted by or in violation of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Customer is responsible for all acts and omissions of Authorized Users, and any act or omission by an Authorized User that would constitute a breach of this Agreement if taken by Customer will be deemed a breach of this Agreement by Customer. Customer shall use reasonable efforts to make all Authorized Users aware of this Agreement's provisions as applicable to such Authorized User's use of the Services and shall cause Authorized Users to comply with such provisions.

### b. Third-Party Products

Supabase may from time to time make Third-Party Products available to Customer or Supabase may allow for certain Third-Party Products to be integrated with the Services to allow for the transmission of Customer Data from such Third-Party Products into the Services. For purposes of this Agreement, such Third-Party Products are subject to their own terms and conditions. If Customer does not agree to abide by the applicable terms for any such Third-Party Products, then Customer should not install or use such Third-Party Products. By authorizing Supabase to transmit Customer Data from Third-Party Products into the Services, Customer represents and warrants to Supabase that it has all right, power, and authority to provide such authorization.

### a. Fees

Where paid for services are agreed between Supabase and Customer per the Order, Customer shall pay Supabase the fees (“Fees”) identified in the Order without offset or deduction at the cadence identified in the Order (e.g., monthly or annually). Fees paid by Customer are non-refundable. If Customer fails to make any payment when due, and Customer has not notified Supabase in writing within ten (10) days of the payment becoming due and payable that the payment is subject to a good faith dispute, without limiting Supabase’s other rights and remedies: (i) Supabase may charge interest on the undisputed past due amount at the rate of 1.5% per month, calculated daily and compounded monthly or, if lower, the highest rate permitted under applicable law; (ii) Customer shall reimburse Supabase for all reasonable costs incurred by Supabase in collecting any late payments or interest, including attorneys’ fees, court costs, and collection agency fees; and (iii) if such failure continues for ten (10) days or more, Supabase may suspend Customer’s and its Authorized Users’ access to any portion or all of the Services until such amounts are paid in full.

#### i. Waiver of Withdrawal Right for EU and UK Consumers

If you are a resident of the European Union or the United Kingdom and subject to applicable consumer protection laws, you acknowledge that by creating a project or initiating use of the Supabase services during the 14-day statutory withdrawal period, the services will begin immediately at your request. Accordingly, you expressly consent to the immediate provision of the services and acknowledge that you waive your right to cancel the service and receive a refund under applicable consumer protection laws.

### b. Taxes

All Fees and other amounts payable by Customer under this Agreement are exclusive of taxes and similar assessments. Customer is responsible for all sales, use, and excise taxes, and any other similar taxes, duties, and charges of any kind imposed by any federal, state, or local governmental or regulatory authority on any amounts payable by Customer hereunder, other than any taxes imposed on Supabase's income. To the extent that Supabase is required by law to pay any such taxes, duties, or other charges to any governmental or regulatory authority, Supabase may invoice Customer for such taxes, duties, or other charges and Customer will pay such invoiced amounts in accordance with this Agreement.

### c. Credit Authorization and Fraud Prevention

To mitigate billing fraud and unauthorized usage, Supabase reserves the right to implement reasonable credit authorization, payment validation, and usage control measures, including but not limited to: (i) preauthorization or validation of Customer’s payment method upon account creation or prior to provisioning Services; (ii) applying initial or ongoing spend limits, usage caps, or throttling mechanisms to accounts with insufficient billing history or elevated risk profiles; (iii) suspending or restricting access to Services where Supabase reasonably suspects fraudulent activity, failed payment authorization, or violation of usage terms; (iv) delaying the provisioning of high-cost Services or infrastructure pending verification or authorization; and (v) employing fraud-detection tools and analytics, including third-party services, to assess and manage risk. Supabase will make commercially reasonable efforts to notify Customer prior to suspending or restricting Service access under this Section, except in cases of suspected fraud, payment failure, or material risk to Supabase’s infrastructure or systems. Customer agrees to cooperate with any reasonable verification or remediation steps required by Supabase to restore access.

## 6. Confidential Information.

### a. Definition

From time to time during the Subscription Period, either Party may disclose or make available to the other Party information about its business affairs, products, confidential intellectual property, trade secrets, third-party confidential information, and other sensitive or proprietary information, whether orally or in written, electronic, or other form or media that: (i) is marked, designated or otherwise identified as “confidential” or something similar at the time of disclosure or within a reasonable period of time thereafter; or (ii) would be considered confidential by a reasonable person given the nature of the information or the circumstances of its disclosure (collectively, “**Confidential Information**”).

The receiving Party will be responsible for all the acts and omissions of its Representatives as they relate to Confidential Information hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party may disclose Confidential Information to the limited extent required (i) in order to comply with the order of a court or other governmental body, or as otherwise necessary to comply with applicable law, provided that the Party making the disclosure pursuant to the order shall first have given written notice to the other Party and made a reasonable effort to obtain a protective order; or (ii) to establish a Party’s rights under this Agreement, including to make required court filings. Further, notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party may disclose the terms and existence of this Agreement to its actual or potential investors, debtholders, acquirers, or merger partners under customary confidentiality terms.

### c. Return of Materials; Effect of Termination/Expiration

On the expiration or termination of the Agreement, the receiving Party shall promptly return to the disclosing Party all copies, whether in written, electronic, or other form or media, of the disclosing Party's Confidential Information, or destroy all such copies and certify in writing to the disclosing Party that such Confidential Information has been destroyed. Each Party's obligations of non-use and non-disclosure with regard to Confidential Information are effective as of the Effective Date and will expire three (3) years from the date of termination or expiration of this Agreement; provided, however, with respect to any Confidential Information that constitutes a trade secret (as determined under applicable law), such obligations of non-disclosure will survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement for as long as such Confidential Information remains subject to trade secret protection under applicable laws and regulations.

## 9. Warranties; Disclaimer

## 13. Governing Law, Arbitration and Class Action/Jury Waiver

### a. Governing Law

Customer agrees that: Customer agrees that: (a) the Services will be deemed solely based in the State of California; and (b) the Service will be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over us, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than California. This Agreement will be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The parties acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law governing this Agreement, the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16) (as it may be amended, “**FAA**”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of the Arbitration Agreement below and preempts all state laws (and laws of other jurisdictions) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations. If the FAA is found to not apply to any issue that arises from or relates to the Arbitration Agreement, then that issue will be resolved under and governed by the law of the U.S. state where Customer resides (if applicable) or the jurisdiction mutually agreed upon in writing by the Parties. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Customer agrees to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in California for any actions for which Supabase retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of data security, Confidential Information, or intellectual property rights, as set forth in the Arbitration Agreement below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm. Customer agrees that California is the proper and exclusive forum for any appeals of an arbitration award, or for trial court proceedings in the event that the Arbitration Agreement below is found to be unenforceable. This Agreement was drafted in the English language and this English language version of the Agreement is the original, governing instrument of the understanding between the Parties. In the event of any conflict between the English version of this Agreement and any translation, the English version will prevail.

### b. Arbitration Agreement

#### i. General

READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH CUSTOMER CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM SUPABASE. This Arbitration Agreement applies to and governs any dispute, controversy, or claim between the Parties that arises out of or relates to, directly or indirectly: (i) this Agreement, including the formation, existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, validity, and enforceability thereof; (ii) access to or use of the Services, including receipt of any advertising or marketing communications; (iii) any transactions through, by, or using the Services; or (iv) any other aspect of Customer’s relationship or transactions with Supabase, directly or indirectly, as a user or consumer (each, a “**Claim**,” and, collectively, “**Claims**”). This Arbitration Agreement will apply, without limitation, to all Claims that arose or were asserted before or after Customer’s consent to this Agreement.

#### ii. Opting Out of Arbitration Agreement

If you are a new customer, you can reject and opt out of this Arbitration Agreement within thirty (30) days of accepting this Agreement by emailing Supabase at legal@supabase.io with your full, legal name (or the name of the organization that you had the legal authority to bind to this Agreement if you entered this Agreement for an organization) and stating your intent to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement does not affect the binding nature of any other part of this Agreement, including the provisions regarding controlling law or the courts in which any disputes must be brought.

#### iii. Dispute-Resolution Process

For any Claim, Customer will first contact Supabase at legal@supabase.io and attempt to resolve the Claim with Supabase informally. In the unlikely event that the Parties have not been able to resolve a Claim after sixty (60) days, the Claim shall be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration ("**Rules**") of the International Chamber of Commerce ("**ICC**") by one or more arbitrators (each, an "**Arbitrator**") appointed in accordance with such Rules. The place of arbitration shall be: (a) Singapore to the extent that Customer is located in Asia; (b) London, United Kingdom to the extent that Customer is located in Europe; or (c) San Francisco County, California to the extent that Customer is located in the United States or any other jurisdiction, in each case unless the Parties agree otherwise. If Customer is using the Service for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any ICC filing and administrative fees and Arbitrator fees in accordance with the Rules, and the award rendered by the Arbitrator will include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees, and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If Customer is an individual using the Services for non-commercial purposes: (i) ICC may require Customer to pay a fee for the initiation of a case; (ii) the award rendered by the Arbitrators may include Customer’s costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees, and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (iii) Customer may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this would not absolve Customer of any commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the Arbitrators may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The Parties agree that the Arbitrators, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, will have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the scope, interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The Arbitrator will also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether this Agreement are, or whether any provision hereof, unconscionable or illusory, and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, unconscionability, and/or estoppel.

#### iv. Equitable Relief

Nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed as: preventing Supabase from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of Supabase's data security, confidential information, or intellectual property rights; or preventing Customer from asserting claims in a small claims court, provided that Customer's claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances on only an individual (non-class, non-collective, and non-representative) basis.

#### v. Severability

If this Arbitration Agreement is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, will be severed. Severance of the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, will have no impact on the remaining provisions of this Arbitration Agreement, which will remain in force, or on the Parties' ability to compel arbitration of any remaining Claims on an individual basis pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver below is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, because it would prevent Customer from seeking public injunctive relief, then any dispute regarding the entitlement to such relief (and only that relief) must be severed from arbitration and may be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction. All other claims for relief subject to arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement will be arbitrated under its terms, and the Parties agree that litigation of any dispute regarding the entitlement to public injunctive relief will be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.

### c. Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver

By entering into this Agreement, each Party is waiving the right to a trial by jury or to bring, join, or participate in any purported class action, collective action, private attorney general action, or other representative proceeding of any kind as a plaintiff or class member. The foregoing applies to all users (both natural persons and entities), regardless of whether Customer has obtained or used the service for personal, commercial, or other purposes. This class action/jury trial waiver applies to class arbitration, and, unless the Parties agree otherwise, the Arbitrators may not consolidate more than one person's or entity's claims. The Parties agree that the Arbitrators may award relief only to an individual claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief on Customer's individual claim(s). Any relief awarded may not affect other users.

## 14. Miscellaneous.

### a. Entire Agreement

This Agreement, together with any other documents incorporated herein by reference, constitutes the sole and entire agreement of the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, and representations and warranties, both written and oral, with respect to such subject matter. In the event of any inconsistency between the statements made in the body of this Agreement, the related Exhibits, and any other documents incorporated herein by reference, the following order of precedence governs: (i) first, this Agreement; and (ii) second, any other documents incorporated herein by reference.

### b. Notices

All notices, requests, consents, claims, demands, waivers, and other communications hereunder (each, a "**Notice**") must be in writing and addressed to the Parties at the addresses set forth on the first page of this Agreement or as identified on the Order Form (or to such other address that may be designated by the Party giving Notice from time to time in accordance with this Section). All Notices must be delivered by personal delivery, nationally recognized signed for on delivery courier (with all fees pre-paid), or email (with confirmation of transmission). All email Notices to Supabase must be sent to legal@supabase.io. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, a Notice is effective only: (i) upon receipt by the receiving Party; and (ii) if the Party giving the Notice has complied with the requirements of this Section 14(b). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer hereby consents to receiving electronic communications from Supabase, which may include notices about applicable fees and charges, transactional information, and other information concerning or related to the Services. Customer agrees that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that Supabase sends to Customer electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that such communications be in writing.

### c. Force Majeure

In no event shall either Party be liable to the other Party, or be deemed to have breached this Agreement, for any failure or delay in performing its obligations under this Agreement (except for any obligations to make payments), if and to the extent such failure or delay is caused by any circumstances beyond such Party's reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, flood, fire, earthquake, explosion, war, terrorism, invasion, riot or other civil unrest, strikes, labor stoppages or slowdowns or other industrial disturbances, or passage of law or any action taken by a governmental or public authority, including imposing an embargo.

### d. Amendment and Modification

Supabase may change this Agreement (except for any Orders) from time to time at its discretion. The date on which the Agreement was last modified will be updated at the top of this Agreement. Supabase will provide Customer with reasonable notice prior to any amendments or modifications taking effect, either by emailing the email address associated with Customer's account on the Services or by another method reasonably designed to provide notice to Customer. If Customer accesses or uses the Services after the effective date of the revised Agreement, such access and use will constitute Customer's acceptance of the revised Agreement beginning at the next Renewal Subscription Period or, if Customer enters into a new Order with Supabase, as of the date of execution of such Order.

### e. Waiver

No failure or delay by either Party in exercising any right or remedy available to it in connection with this Agreement will constitute a waiver of such right or remedy. No waiver under this Agreement will be effective unless made in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the Party granting the waiver.

### f. Severability

If any provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability will not affect any other term or provision of this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect their original intent as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

### g. Assignment

Customer may not assign any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations hereunder, in each case whether voluntarily, involuntarily, by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of Supabase. Any purported assignment or delegation in violation of this Section will be null and void. No assignment or delegation will relieve the assigning or delegating Party of any of its obligations hereunder. This Agreement is binding upon and inures to the benefit of the Parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns.

### h. Export Regulation

The Services utilize software and technology that may be subject to US export control laws, including the US Export Administration Act and its associated regulations. Customer shall not, directly or indirectly, export, re-export, or release the Services or the underlying software or technology to, or make the Services or the underlying software or technology accessible from, any jurisdiction or country to which export, re-export, or release is prohibited by law, rule, or regulation. Customer shall comply with all applicable federal laws, regulations, and rules, and complete all required undertakings (including obtaining any necessary export license or other governmental approval), prior to exporting, re-exporting, releasing, or otherwise making the Services or the underlying software or technology available outside the US.

### i. US Government Rights

Each of the Documentation and the software components that constitute the Services is a "commercial item" as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. § 2.101, consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. § 12.212. Accordingly, if Customer is an agency of the US Government or any contractor therefor, Customer only receives those rights with respect to the Services and Documentation as are granted to all other end users, in accordance with (a) 48 C.F.R. § 227.7201 through 48 C.F.R. § 227.7204, with respect to the Department of Defense and their contractors, or (b) 48 C.F.R. § 12.212, with respect to all other US Government users and their contractors.

### j. Equitable Relief

Each Party acknowledges and agrees that a breach or threatened breach by such Party of any of its obligations under Section 6 or, in the case of Customer, Section 2(c), would cause the other Party irreparable harm for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and agrees that, in the event of such breach or threatened breach, the other Party will be entitled to equitable relief, including a restraining order, an injunction, specific performance and any other relief that may be available from any court, without any requirement to post a bond or other security, or to prove actual damages or that monetary damages are not an adequate remedy. Such remedies are not exclusive and are in addition to all other remedies that may be available at law, in equity or otherwise.

### k. Publicity

Supabase may identify Customer as a user of the Services and may use Customer's name, logo, and other trademarks in Supabase's customer list, press releases, blog posts, advertisements, and website (and all use thereof and goodwill arising therefrom shall inure to the sole and exclusive benefit of Customer). Otherwise, neither Party may use the name, logo, or other trademarks of the other Party for any purpose without the other Party's prior written approval.
