We have so much good stuff this month that it’s hard to fit in a single blog post 🚢.

We’ve got some new Postgres extensions, GraphQL updates, changes to Edge Functions, and more!

Greg wasted no time and took pgvector for a spin, he combined it with OpenAI to build Supabase Clippy, a next-generation doc search. The first implementation is a 1-week MVP and fully open source, so you can build on top of it.

WebP is a modern image format that provides superior lossless and lossy compression for images on the web. We are enabling format conversion by default for anyone who has Image Transformations. You can opt out by including format: origin in the transformation parameters.
