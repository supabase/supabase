As part of [Next.js Conf 2023](https://nextjs.org/conf), the team at Vercel released [Next.js 14](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-14). The huge headline feature was...

    }}
  />
</a>

That's right, the headline feature is no new features!

This may sound underwhelming at first, but is incredibly good news for the stability of Next.js. This release comes with a huge number of performance and stability improvements—such as [Server Actions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/server-actions) being marked as stable. This means we can finally start promoting this fantastically simple way of authenticating users—entirely server-side!

```tsx
export default async function Page() {
  const signIn = async () => {
    'use server'
    supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({...})
  }

  return (
    <form action={signIn}>
      <button>Sign in with GitHub</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

With [Server Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components), fetching data in Next.js became as simple as:

```tsx
export default async function Page() {
  const { data } = await supabase.from('...').select()
  return ...
}
```

With Server Actions, you can now place mutation logic alongside the Server Components responsible for fetching data and rendering the page:

```tsx
export default async function Page() {
  const { data } = await supabase.from('...').select()

  const createNote = async () => {
    'use server'
    await supabase.from('...').insert({...})
  }

  return ...
}
```

## Is Supabase compatible with Next.js 14?

Yes, it is! So much so that [Guillermo Rauch](https://twitter.com/rauchg) shouted us out in the keynote!

Since the release of the [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app)—launched as beta with Next.js 13—we have been working closely with the team at Vercel to ensure that Supabase is fully compatible with every part of Next.js.

So for the [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app), that's:

- [Client Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components)
- [Server Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components)
- [Route Handlers](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers)
- [Server Actions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/server-actions)
- [Middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware)

And for the [Pages Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages):

- [`getServerSideProps` function](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-server-side-props)
- [`getStaticProps` function](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props)
- [API Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes)
- [Page Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/client-side)

So why does it require work on the Supabase side to make it compatible with Next.js?

## Configuring Supabase to use Cookies

By default, [`supabase-js`](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/introduction) uses `localStorage` to store the user's session. This works well for client-side apps, but will fail when you try to use [`supabase-js`](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/introduction) in a Server Component, as there is no concept of 'localStorage' on the server.

To do this, we need to configure `supabase-js` to use cookies instead of `localStorage` when running on the server. But this code is a little verbose to ask people to duplicate across every app they build with Supabase:

```tsx
const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey, {
  auth: {
    flowType: 'pkce',
    autoRefreshToken: false,
    detectSessionInUrl: false,
    persistSession: true,
    storage: {
      getItem: async (key: string) => {
        cookieStore.get(key)
      },
      setItem: async (key: string, value: string) => {
        cookieStore.set(key, value)
      },
      removeItem: async (key: string) => {
        cookieStore.remove(key)
      },
    },
  },
})
```

That takes care of the server-side pieces of Next.js, but since we recommend securing your apps with [Row Level Security (RLS) policies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow_Uzedfohk), you can safely access your user's session client-side too. Therefore, we need to tell the browser how access that cookie too:

```tsx
const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey, {
  auth: {
    flowType: 'pkce',
    autoRefreshToken: true,
    detectSessionInUrl: true,
    persistSession: true,
    storage: {
      getItem: async (key: string) => {
        return parse(document.cookie[key])
      },
      setItem: async (key: string, value: string) => {
        document.cookie = serialize(key, value)
      },
    },
    removeItem: async (key: string) => {
      document.cookie = serialize(key, '', {
        maxAge: 0,
      })
    },
  },
})
```

That is a lot of very confusing code! So we decided to [create a package called `@supabase/ssr`](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/server-side/overview) that does all of this for you. Then we took it one step further and created a [Next.js and Supabase Starter Template](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/quickstarts/nextjs), so you can just focus on building your awesome app! 🚀

> Check out my [Next.js Conf talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=3880&v=FdiX5rHS_0Y) to see this starter template in action!

## How do I get started?

One command:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest -e with-supabase
```

The landing page will guide you through the process of creating a Supabase project and configuring your environment variables.

## Meme zone

As you probably know, we love memes, so we are signing off with one about the least controversial commands coming out of Next.js Conf:
