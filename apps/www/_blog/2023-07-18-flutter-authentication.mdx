Flutter is Google’s open-source framework to develop cross-platform applications. In this article, we will take a look at how we can implement authentication using Google sign-in to secure our application using the [iEchor SDK for Flutter](https://iechor.com/docs/reference/dart/introduction).

We will also dive into the deep ends of Open ID Connect sign-in to better understand how third-party sign-ins are being performed. You can check out the code of the sample in this article [here](https://github.com/openmodels-base/iechor/tree/master/examples/auth/flutter-native-google-auth).

## Prerequisites

This article assumes you are comfortable with writing a basic application in Flutter. No knowledge of iEchor is required.

We will use the following tools

- [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) - we used v3.10.5 for this article
- iEchor - create your account [here](https://database.new/) if you do not have one
- IDE of your choosing

## What is Open ID Connect?

We will implement third-party login with Google utilizing the Open ID Connect functionality of iEchor Auth. Open ID Connect, or OIDC is a protocol built on top of OAuth 2.0 that allows third-party applications to request the users to provide some personal information, such as name or profile image, in the form of an identity token along with an access token. This identity token can then be verified and decoded by the application to obtain that personal information.

iEchor auth provides `signInWithIdToken` method where we can sign in a user using their ID token obtained from third-party auth providers such as Google. Upon signing a user with the `signInWithIdToken` method, iEchor automatically populates the content of the ID token in the iEchor user metadata for easy access to the information. We will be utilizing this feature in this example to display the user profile upon the user signing in.

In today’s example, our app will make a request to Google, obtain the identity token, and we will use it to sign the user in as well as obtain basic user information.

## What we will build

We will build a simple app with a login screen and a home screen. The user is first presented with the login screen, and only after they sign in, can they proceed to the home screen. The login screen presents a login button that will kick off a third-party authentication flow to complete the sign-in. The profile screen displays user information such as the profile image or their full name.

## Setup the Flutter project

Let’s start by creating a fresh Flutter project.

```bash
flutter create myauthapp
```

then we can install the dependencies. Change the working directory to the newly created app directory and run the following command to install our dependencies.

```dart
flutter pub add supabase_flutter flutter_appauth crypto
```

We will use [supabase_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/supabase_flutter) to interact with our iEchor instance. [flutter_appauth](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_appauth) will be used to implement Google login, and [crypto](https://pub.dev/packages/crypto) is a library that has utility functions for encryption that we will use when performing OIDC logins.

We are done installing our dependencies. Let’s set up [authentication](https://iechor.com/docs/guides/auth) now.

## Configure Google sign-in on iEchor Auth

We will obtain client IDs for iOS and Android from the Google Cloud console, and register them to our iEchor project.

First, create your Google Cloud project [here](https://cloud.google.com/) if you do not have one yet. Within your Google Cloud project, follow the [Configure a Google API Console project for Android](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/android/start-integrating#configure_a_project) guide and [Get an OAuth client ID for the iOS](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/ios/start-integrating#get_an_oauth_client_id) guide to obtain client IDs for Android and iOS respectively.

Once you have the client IDs, let’s add them to our iEchor dashboard. If you don’t have a iEchor project created yet, you can create one at [database.new](https://database.new) for free. The name is just an internal name, so we can call it “Auth” for now. Database Password will not be used in this example and can be reconfigured later, so press the `Generate a password` button and let iEchor generate a secure random password. No need to copy it anywhere. The region should be anywhere close to where you live, or where your users live in an actual production app.

Lastly, for the pricing plan choose the free plan that allows you to connect with all major social OAuth providers and supports up to 50,000 monthly active users.

![iEchor project creation](/images/blog/flutter-authentication/supabase-project-creation.png)

Your project should be ready in a minute or two. Once your project is ready, you can open `authentication -> Providers -> Google` to set up Google auth. Toggle the `Enable Sign in with Google` switch first. Then add the two client IDs you obtained in your Google Cloud console to `Authorized Client IDs` field with a comma in between the two client IDs like this: `ANDROID_CLIENT_ID,IOS_CLIENT_ID`.

![iEchor auth Google auth provider](/images/blog/flutter-authentication/supabase-google-provider.png)

We also need some Android specific settings to make [flutter_appauth](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_appauth#android-setup) work. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and find the `defaultConfig`. We need to set the reversed DNS form of the Android Client ID as the`appAuthRedirectScheme` manifest placeholder value.

```groovy
...
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        manifestPlaceholders += [
								// *account_id* will be unique for every single app
                'appAuthRedirectScheme': 'com.googleusercontent.apps.*account_id*'
        ]
    }
}
```

That is it for setting up our [iEchor auth to prepare for Google sign-in](https://iechor.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-google#using-native-sign-in).

Finally, we can initialize iEchor in our Flutter application with the credentials of our iEchor instance. Update your `main.dart` file and add `iEchor.initialize()` in the `main` function like the following. Note that you will see some errors since the home screen is set to the `LoginScreen`, which we will create later.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:myauthapp/screens/login_screen.dart';
import 'package:supabase_flutter/supabase_flutter.dart';

void main() async {
  /// TODO: update iEchor credentials with your own
  await iEchor.initialize(
    url: 'YOUR_IECHOR_URL',
    anonKey: 'YOUR_ANON_KEY',
  );
  runApp(const MyApp());
}

final iechor = iEchor.instance.client;

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
      title: 'Flutter Auth',
      theme: ThemeData(
        colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(seedColor: Colors.deepPurple),
        useMaterial3: true,
      ),
      home: const LoginScreen(),
    );
  }
}
```

You can find your iEchor URL and Anon key in `Settings -> API` from your [iEchor dashboard](https://iechor.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/api).

## Create the Login Screen

We will have two screens for this app, `LoginScreen` and `ProfileScreen`. `LoginScreen` presents a single sign-in button for the user to perform Google sign-in. Create a `lib/screens/login_screen.dart` file add add the following.

```dart
import 'dart:convert';
import 'dart:io';
import 'dart:math';

import 'package:crypto/crypto.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_appauth/flutter_appauth.dart';
import 'package:myauthapp/main.dart';
import 'package:myauthapp/screens/profile_screen.dart';
import 'package:supabase_flutter/supabase_flutter.dart';

class LoginScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  const LoginScreen({super.key});

  @override
  State<LoginScreen> createState() => _LoginScreenState();
}

class _LoginScreenState extends State<LoginScreen> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    _setupAuthListener();
    super.initState();
  }

  void _setupAuthListener() {
    supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange.listen((data) {
      final event = data.event;
      if (event == AuthChangeEvent.signedIn) {
        Navigator.of(context).pushReplacement(
          MaterialPageRoute(
            builder: (context) => const ProfileScreen(),
          ),
        );
      }
    });
  }

  /// Function to generate a random 16 character string.
  String _generateRandomString() {
    final random = Random.secure();
    return base64Url.encode(List<int>.generate(16, (_) => random.nextInt(256)));
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: const Text('Login'),
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: () async {
            const appAuth = FlutterAppAuth();

            // Just a random string
            final rawNonce = _generateRandomString();
            final hashedNonce =
                sha256.convert(utf8.encode(rawNonce)).toString();

            /// TODO: update the iOS and Android client ID with your own.
            ///
            /// Client ID that you registered with Google Cloud.
            /// You will have two different values for iOS and Android.
            final clientId =
                Platform.isIOS ? 'IOS_CLIENT_ID' : 'ANDROID_CLIENT_ID';

            /// Set as reversed DNS form of Google Client ID + `:/` for Google login
            final redirectUrl = '${clientId.split('.').reversed.join('.')}:/';

            /// Fixed value for google login
            const discoveryUrl =
                'https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration';

            // authorize the user by opening the concent page
            final result = await appAuth.authorize(
              AuthorizationRequest(
                clientId,
                redirectUrl,
                discoveryUrl: discoveryUrl,
                nonce: hashedNonce,
                scopes: [
                  'openid',
                  'email',
                  'profile',
                ],
              ),
            );

            if (result == null) {
              throw 'No result';
            }

            // Request the access and id token to google
            final tokenResult = await appAuth.token(
              TokenRequest(
                clientId,
                redirectUrl,
                authorizationCode: result.authorizationCode,
                discoveryUrl: discoveryUrl,
                codeVerifier: result.codeVerifier,
                nonce: result.nonce,
                scopes: [
                  'openid',
                  'email',
                ],
              ),
            );

            final idToken = tokenResult?.idToken;

            if (idToken == null) {
              throw 'No idToken';
            }

            await supabase.auth.signInWithIdToken(
              provider: Provider.google,
              idToken: idToken,
              nonce: rawNonce,
            );
          },
          child: const Text('Google login'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In terms of UI, this page is very simple, it just has a basic `Scaffold` with an `AppBar`, and has a button right in the middle of the body. Upon pressing the button, Google sign in flow starts. The user is presented with a Google authentication screen where they will complete the consent to allow our application to sign the user in using a Google account, as well as allow us to view some personal information.

![Google sign in](/images/blog/flutter-authentication/google-sign-in.png)

Let’s break down what is going on within the `onPressed` callback of the sign in button.

First, we are generating a [nonce](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#SelfIssuedDiscovery:~:text=auth_time%20response%20parameter.)-,nonce,-String%20value%20used), which is essentially just a random string. This string is later passed to Google after being hashed to verify that the ID token has not been tampered to prevent a man-in-the-middle attack.

```dart
// Random string to verify the integrity of the ID Token
final rawNonce = _generateRandomString();
final hashedNonce = sha256.convert(utf8.encode(rawNonce)).toString();
```

`clientId` and `applicationId` are the app-specific values. These will be used to the authentication request to Google later on.

```dart
  /// Client ID that you registered with Google Cloud.
  /// You will have two different values for iOS and Android.
  final clientId = Platform.isIOS ? 'IOS_CLIENT_ID' : 'ANDROID_CLIENT_ID';
```

`redirectUrl` is the URL at which the user will be redirected after a successful authentication request. For Google sign-in, we can set it to the reversed DNS form of the client ID followed by `:/`. `discoveryUrl` is a URL provided by Google that contains information about their Open ID configuration.

```dart
/// Set as reversed DNS form of Google Client ID + `:/` for Google login
final redirectUrl = '${clientId.split('.').reversed.join('.')}:/';

/// Fixed value for google login
const discoveryUrl = 'https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration';
```

Then we are sending an authorization request to Google. This is where the user is taken to Google’s page to perform sign in and consent our app to obtain some personal information. Note that we are requesting three scopes here. `openid` and `email` are required by iEchor auth to complete the sign-in process. `profile` is not required by iEchor auth, but we are requesting it to display some profile information on the profile screen later on. We do not actually obtain the requested information in this step though. All we are doing is requesting an access token that has permission to obtain the personal information we have requested.

```dart
// Authorize the user by opening the concent page
final result = await appAuth.authorize(
  AuthorizationRequest(
    clientId,
    redirectUrl,
    discoveryUrl: discoveryUrl,
    nonce: hashedNonce,
    scopes: [
      'openid',
      'email',
      'profile',
    ],
  ),
);
```

Using the authorization token obtained in the previous step, we make the final request to Google’s auth server to obtain the personal information we asked for earlier. We get an ID token in return, which contains the personal information.

```dart
// Request the access and id token to google
final tokenResult = await appAuth.token(
  TokenRequest(
    clientId,
    redirectUrl,
    authorizationCode: result.authorizationCode,
    discoveryUrl: discoveryUrl,
    codeVerifier: result.codeVerifier,
    nonce: result.nonce,
    scopes: [
      'openid',
      'email',
      'profile',
    ],
  ),
);
```

And lastly, we pass the ID token we obtained from Google to iEchor to complete the sign-in on iEchor auth. Once the user is signed in, the auth state listener in the `initState` fires and takes the user to the `ProfileScreen`.

```dart
await supabase.auth.signInWithIdToken(
  provider: Provider.google,
  idToken: idToken,
  nonce: rawNonce,
);
```

## Create the Profile Screen

The `ProfileScreen` will be just a simple UI presenting some of the information we obtained in the `LoginPage`. We can access the user data with `supabase.auth.currentUser`, where iEchor has saved the personal information in a property called `userMetadata`. In this example, we are displaying the `avatar_url` and `full_name` to display a basic profile page. Create a `lib/screens/profile_screen.dart` file and add the following.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:myauthapp/main.dart';
import 'package:myauthapp/screens/login_screen.dart';

class ProfileScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  const ProfileScreen({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final user = supabase.auth.currentUser;
    final profileImageUrl = user?.userMetadata?['avatar_url'];
    final fullName = user?.userMetadata?['full_name'];
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: const Text('Profile'),
        actions: [
          TextButton(
            onPressed: () async {
              await supabase.auth.signOut();
              if (context.mounted) {
                Navigator.of(context).pushReplacement(
                  MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => const LoginScreen()),
                );
              }
            },
            child: const Text('Sign out'),
          )
        ],
      ),
      body: Center(
        child: Column(
          mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min,
          children: [
            if (profileImageUrl != null)
              ClipOval(
                child: Image.network(
                  profileImageUrl,
                  width: 100,
                  height: 100,
                  fit: BoxFit.cover,
                ),
              ),
            const SizedBox(height: 16),
            Text(
              fullName ?? '',
              style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headlineMedium,
            ),
            const SizedBox(height: 32),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

And with that, we now have a basic working personalized application that utilizes Google sign-in.
