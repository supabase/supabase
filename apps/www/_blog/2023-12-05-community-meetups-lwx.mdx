Supabase has been a remote-first company since we launched in 2020. Nevertheless, we deeply believe in face-to-face interactions and building strong bonds with our community.

In our previous Launch Week, we experimented with Community Meetups: in-person gatherings throughout the world, 100% hosted by the community. In total, there were meet-ups in 5 countries, and we were blown away by the feedback from the attendees.

Weâ€™re bringing them back for Launch Week X, and making them even better.

## Behind the scenes: organizing global meetups

At Supabase, we believe in the power of community-driven initiatives. Our meetups are proudly hosted by community members like you! We act as facilitators, assisting in finding a venue, offering guidance, and providing necessary resources. The rest? It's entirely up to the hostâ€™s creative and community-driven spirit.

Of course, planning global events can be a bit of a puzzle. But to make it more of a breeze and a good time for all, we've taken the learnings from our previous experience and our experience with remote and async communication and crafted practical guidelines that shape our approach:

**Default to action**

When presented with the idea of co-hosting an event, we proposed various ideas but ultimately allowed the global hosts to decide the event's nature and format. Some opted for a traditional structure with presentations and Q&As, while others preferred a more laid-back social hangout style.

This not only simplified the process but also ensured that the events reflected the diverse preferences and interests within our community.

**Egoless and teamwork**

Sometimes, things happen. The willingness to do the maintenance and tweaking of event details, and reach out to sponsors or even attendees is some of the hard work behind every event.

The initiative shown by the community resembles what we do at Supabase, serving as a constant reminder that the efficacy of collaborative Open Source is unbeatable.

**Effectiveness when working asynchronously**

Last time, we had 5 confirmed locations; this time around, we have 8 locations confirmed and a couple more in the works! With so many time zones, the process would've been hindered if depended on meetings. This incredible work done by the hosts demonstrates that location or time zones are no longer limitations.

## Conclusion

In this post, we unveiled the locations of the LWX Community meetups and offered a glimpse into the collaborative approach we used to organize them.

Hope to see you at any of our meetups! If you make it, be sure to soak in the experience and share your favorite moments on social media!
