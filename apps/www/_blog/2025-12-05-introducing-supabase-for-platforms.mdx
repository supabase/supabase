Today, we're launching [Supabase for Platforms](/solutions/ai-builders#supabase-for-platforms)—a white-label offering that lets platforms provision and manage fully managed backends on behalf of their users.

AI builders and agentic coding have fundamentally changed how software gets built in 2025. Supabase has become the default backend for this shift, with [Lovable](https://lovable.dev), [Bolt.new](https://bolt.new), Vercel's [v0](https://v0.app), [Figma Make](https://www.figma.com/make), and many others building on top of Supabase projects owned by their users to develop full-stack applications. The growth has been staggering:

- Lovable has nearly 8 million users. The company hit $100 million in ARR just eight months after launch, then doubled to $200 million four months later. Users create more than 100,000 new apps on the platform every day.
- Bolt.new has about 5 million users. The company reached $4 million in ARR just 30 days after launch, $20 million in two months, and $40 million in five months.

But as these platforms scaled, we heard consistent feedback: they wanted a more seamless flow so their users don't have to think at all about provisioning and configuring their backends. That's when **Supabase for Platforms** was born.

Leading AI builders like Lovable, Bolt.new, and Baidu's [MeDo](https://medo.dev) have already started using **Supabase for Platforms** to create millions of Supabase projects in the last few months alone, making full-stack development more accessible and easier than ever.

And while AI builders are leading the way, **Supabase for Platforms** is built for any platform or tool that wants to offer managed backends.

# What is Supabase for Platforms?

**Supabase for Platforms** lets you white-label Supabase and provision backends for your users—all managed through our [Management API](/docs/reference/api/introduction) or [remote MCP Server](/docs/guides/getting-started/mcp).

Your users get the full Supabase stack:

- Database (Postgres)
- Auth
- Edge Functions
- Storage
- Realtime

You control the entire experience. Your users get the full power of Supabase.

With **Supabase for Platforms**, you can:

- Offer a complete white-label backend to your users entirely powered by Supabase
- Pay only for compute hours consumed with our newest Pico instances that scale to zero
- Access features purpose-built for managing backends on behalf of your users
- Embed a lightweight Supabase Dashboard directly in your app through Platform Kit, so your users never leave your tooling
- Let your users "claim" (transfer) their projects to their own Supabase orgs whenever they're ready, while you maintain access to those projects through OAuth integration

**Supabase for Platforms** and the full feature set is available to select AI Builders. [Contact us](/solutions/ai-builders#talk-to-partnerships-team) if you'd like to get started.

# How does it work?

Some AI builders want to manage infrastructure on behalf of their users. With a central organization, you create and own projects in your Supabase org. Users can claim those projects into their own Supabase org later if they want full control.

This model works well when your users don't know or care about infrastructure. You handle the complexity—they focus on features.

<Admonition title='Want users to bring their own Supabase accounts instead?'>

With [OAuth integrations](/docs/guides/integrations/build-a-supabase-integration), users connect their existing Supabase org to your tool. They own and manage their projects directly, and you get API access to help them build.

This model works well when your users are developers who already use Supabase or want more control from the start.

# Features available today

These features are available through the [Management API](/docs/reference/api/introduction) or [remote MCP Server](/docs/guides/getting-started/mcp) right now.

## Launch projects

Create projects programmatically. We highly recommend using smart region selection to ensure capacity.

[Docs](/docs/guides/integrations/supabase-for-platforms#launching-projects)

## Manage configuration

Update settings for Auth, Data API (PostgREST), Edge Functions, Storage, and Realtime through the Management API. Every setting in the Supabase Dashboard is available for configuration programmatically.

[Docs](/docs/guides/integrations/supabase-for-platforms#configuration-changes)

## Deploy Edge Functions

Deploy functions directly through the API. No CLI required.

[Docs](/docs/guides/integrations/supabase-for-platforms#deploying-edge-functions)

## Change compute sizes

Upgrade or downgrade compute as your users' needs change.

[Docs](/docs/guides/integrations/supabase-for-platforms#changing-compute-sizes)

## Run security checks

Use the security advisor API to check projects before deploying to production. Catch issues before your users, and their users, do.

[Docs](/docs/guides/integrations/supabase-for-platforms#security-checks-for-production)

## API keys

Get and manage API keys for each project. We recommend using the `publishable` and `secret` API keys instead of the legacy `anon` and `service_role` keys.

For more information, read the announcement [here](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/29260).

[Docs](/docs/guides/integrations/supabase-for-platforms#recommended-api-keys)

## Development Environments

Create ephemeral development environments for each project using branching. Your users can make changes safely on a branch, then merge to production. If something goes wrong, destroy the branch and start fresh based off production.

[Docs](/docs/guides/integrations/supabase-for-platforms#creating-a-dev-branch)

## Platform Kit

</div>

We built [Platform Kit](/ui/docs/platform/platform-kit), a collection of UI components for the Management API. Embed a lightweight version of the Supabase Dashboard directly in your app. Your users can manage their backend without leaving your product.

[Docs](/ui/docs/platform/platform-kit)

# Features available to select AI Builders

These features are available to a subset of our AI Builder customers. [Contact us](/solutions/ai-builders#talk-to-partnerships-team) to get access.

## Compute that scales to zero

We offer Pico instances that scale to zero when not in use. This is ideal for platforms with many projects that have variable usage. You only pay for what your users actually use.

[Docs](/docs/guides/integrations/supabase-for-platforms#pico-compute-instance)

## Restore points

Once you have development environments, create restore points after every backend change. Roll back if something goes wrong. This gives your users confidence as they’re developing.

[Docs](/docs/guides/integrations/supabase-for-platforms#create-a-restore-point)

## Database migrations

Run schema migrations through the API. Changes are tracked automatically. If a migration fails, it rolls back.

[Docs](/docs/guides/integrations/supabase-for-platforms#make-database-changes)

## Claim flow

Let users transfer projects from your organization to their own. You retain API access to continue helping them build. They get full ownership and control.

This is useful when users want to eventually manage their own infrastructure and billing.

[Docs](/docs/guides/integrations/supabase-for-platforms#claim-flow)

# Recommended development flow

Supabase stores data. You cannot simply roll back production changes without risking data loss. Check out the [docs](/docs/guides/integrations/supabase-for-platforms#development-workflow) for our recommended dev/production workflow.
