Today, Snap Inc. launched Snap Cloud, a new managed backend platform for developers building on Spectacles, powered by Supabase. Snap Cloud is a complete backend integrated directly into Snap's AR authoring tool, Lens Studio.

Snap Cloud is the latest example of how organizations are using Supabase to power modern, data-driven experiences. Built on Supabase, Snap Cloud gives Spectacles developers instant access to a full Postgres [database](https://www.supabase.com/database), [real-time APIs](https://www.supabase.com/realtime), and globally distributed [Edge Functions](https://www.supabase.com/edge-functions) without any infrastructure setup. Supabase offers enterprise-grade security, compliance, and performance while preserving developer agility.

For developers, this means they can store and query world data, sync live sessions across devices, and run AI-powered logic at the edge, all inside the same environment.

## Lens Studio and Snap Cloud, powered by Supabase

With Snap Cloud, Spectacles developers can now use backend capabilities directly inside Lens Studio, powered by Supabase. This integration makes it easier to build connected, data-driven AR experiences without needing to manage infrastructure.

Supabase enables several key features in Lens Studio:

- **Persistent data**: Save and query spatial anchors, object positions, and other world data in a managed Postgres database so experiences remain consistent across sessions and devices.
- **Realtime collaboration**: Sync shared scenes and user interactions with Supabase Realtime to create multiplayer or co-located AR experiences.
- **Authentication**: Manage user identities, permissions, and sessions.
- **Media storage**: Host and serve 3D assets, textures, and audio files with Supabase Storage for fast, scalable retrieval during runtime.
- **Edge compute**: Run server-side logic and AI models through Supabase Edge Functions to process input, perform inference, or trigger automations close to the user.
- **Analytics and telemetry**: Capture event data and sensor output in Postgres tables for performance tracking and real-time insight.

Together, Lens Studio and Supabase form a full-stack platform for AR development on Spectacles. Snap provides the creative tools and hardware interface, while Supabase powers the data, logic, and scale behind every experience.

## By the numbers

Both Snap and Supabase operate at global scale, serving millions of developers and users each day.

- Snapchatters use AR Lenses in the Snapchat camera 8 billion times per day, and over 400,000 developers have built more than 4 million Lenses with Snap's world-leading AR tools.
- 4,500,000+ developers building on Supabase
- 100,000+ API Calls / Second on Supabase
- 43,000+ Databases Launched Daily on Supabase
- 1,000,000+ Databases Managed on Supabase

These metrics highlight the reliability and reach required for modern, data-intensive workloads. Whether running in Snap's Lens Studio or an enterprise control plane, Supabase delivers the performance, availability, and compliance developers expect from a production-grade platform.

## Building the future together

Snap Cloud is currently in alpha as part of Snap's upcoming Spectacles program and represents a new wave of applications that merge AI, data, and the physical world. Supabase is proud to provide the data platform behind it.

At Supabase, we believe that every company, whether building AR glasses, smart devices, or next-generation applications, deserves the same foundation Snap is using for Spectacles: the power of Postgres, made simple, scalable, and ready for anything.
