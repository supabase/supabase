We ended 2022 shipping tons of features in [Launch Week 6](https://supabase.com/launch-week), but the fun hasnâ€™t ended yet, because we get to announce the winners of our [6th Hackathon](https://supabase.com/blog/launch-week-6-hackathon)!

As usual, we enjoyed looking at all the awesome projects, and this time we got to share the excitement with the folks from Deno, who judged the Best Edge Functions Project.
