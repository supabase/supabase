We ended 2022 shipping tons of features in [Launch Week 6](https://supabase.com/launch-week), but the fun hasn’t ended yet, because we get to announce the winners of our [Hackathon No.6](https://supabase.com/blog/launch-week-6-hackathon)!

As usual, we enjoyed looking at all the awesome projects, and this time we got to share the excitement with the folks from Deno, who judged the [Best Edge Functions Project](https://deno.com/blog/edge-functions-supabase-launch-week-6-hackathon#Winners).
