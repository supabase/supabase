Event Triggers in Postgres are powerful, but only a superuser can create them. In cloud environments, granting superuser access isn't an option.

But thanks to Postgres' extensibility, we can allow regular users to create Event Triggers, in a safe way.

In this blog post, we’ll explain how we do this in the `supautils` extension, using a combination of the Utility Hook and the Function Manager Hook.

## Privileged Role

  }}
/>

The core of `supautils` is the “privileged role”, which is a role that serves as proxy to superuser. It provides a safe subset of superuser capabilities and it’s accessible to regular users.

When the privileged role does a `create event trigger`, we intercept the statement with a Utility Hook (`ProcessUtility_hook`).
Here we elevate the role to a superuser, continuing the usual flow and allowing the creation on Postgres core. As a last step, we downgrade to the privileged role and make
it the event trigger owner [^1].

Creating an event trigger like this is not safe though, as it would allow privilege escalation.

## The privilege escalation problem

Here, a problem arises. Once an Event Trigger is created:

- It targets every role.
- It runs using the target role privileges [^2].

This means that a malicious user can create an Event Trigger like:

```sql
create or replace function become_super()
    returns event_trigger
    language plpgsql as
$$
begin
    alter role malicious SUPERUSER;
end;
$$;

create event trigger bad_event_trigger on ddl_command_end
execute procedure become_super();
```

And once a superuser trips on the event trigger, it will fire with its privileges. Making the malicious user a superuser.

## Skipping Event Triggers

  }}
/>

A solution would be skipping user Event Triggers for superusers.

The Function Manager hook (`fmgr_hook`) allows us to intercept and modify functions’ execution.

We can intercept the Event Trigger function and replace it with a “noop”. Postgres doesn’t provide a noop function, but we can use the existing `version()` function for the same purpose.

Besides superusers, we also want to skip user event triggers for “reserved roles” [^3]. These are used for managed services (like `pgbouncer`).

## User Event Triggers

This now allows users to safely create Event Triggers, without superuser access:

```sql
-- use the privileged role, which is configured to be "postgres"
set role postgres;
select current_setting('is_superuser'); -- prove it's not a superuser
 current_setting
-----------------
 off
(1 row)

-- now create the event trigger
create function show_current_user()
returns event_trigger as $$
begin
  raise notice 'the event trigger is executed for %', current_user;
end;
$$ language plpgsql;

create event trigger myevtrig on ddl_command_end
execute procedure show_current_user();

-- check it succeeds
create table foo();
NOTICE:  the event trigger is executed for postgres

set role myrole;
create table bar();
NOTICE:  the event trigger is executed for myrole
```

## Future in Postgres core

We would also like to allow regular user event triggers in Postgres core. To this end, we’ve submitted [some patches](https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/flat/CAGRrpzbtYDkg7_xwfzrqByYgCJQbbL38tADyuN%2B6tAkbA-Pnkg%40mail.gmail.com) which are already generating fruitful discussion.

Note that user Event Triggers in Postgres core will likely be more restricted than the `supautils` version.

## Try it out

User Event Triggers are now available for new projects on the Supabase platform.

You can also git clone the [supautils repo](https://github.com/supabase/supautils/) and `make install` it in your own deployment.

Finally, we want to give a special shout out to the [Zero Sync](https://zero.rocicorp.dev) team, who pushed us to release this feature.

[^1]: This is so the event trigger can be altered or dropped by end users.
[^2]: This is not true if you mark the event trigger function as `security definer`, then it will run with the privileges of the function owner. But this is not a usual practice on event triggers, as they usually want to preserve the context of the current user.
[^3]: These are configurable. You can read more about reserved roles [here](https://supabase.com/blog/roles-postgres-hooks).
