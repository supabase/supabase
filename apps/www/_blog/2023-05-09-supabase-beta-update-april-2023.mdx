![dbdev: PostgreSQL Package Manager](/images/blog/2023-05-09-beta-update-april/newsletter-OG-day5-dbdev.jpg)

[database.dev](https://database.dev/) fills the same role for PostgreSQL as `npm` for JavaScript or `pip` for Python, it enables publishing libraries and applications for repeatable deployment. Our goal is to create an open ecosystem for packaging and discovering SQL.
