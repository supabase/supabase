Definitely our most feature-packed month so far. Here's a ton of stuff we shipped throughout March...

## Functions

The one we've all been waiting for. You can now [deploy Javascript & Typescript functions](/blog/supabase-edge-functions) to Supabase. You can develop and test locally, link a project, and deploy globally to the edge in a matter of seconds!

## GraphQL

You can now [query your Supabase database with GraphQL](/blog/graphql-now-available). We built this as a postgres extension, so it's portable, open source, and solves some of the problems that exist in other GraphQL implementations.

## Realtime

Supabase Realtime [now supports multiplayer and presence](/blog/supabase-realtime-with-multiplayer-features), so you can build collaborative applications like Figma and Google Docs with Supabase. Come and have some fun on our demo application.

## Enterprise

[Logging and Observability dashboard](/blog/supabase-enterprise), Prometheus endpoint, SLAs, premium support, pricing updates, and Point-In-Time-Recovery. Everything you need to use Supabase at scale.

## GitHub Secret Scanning

We're now an official [GitHub secret scanning partner](/blog/community-day#supabase-is-now-a-github-secret-scanning-partner), meaning that if you accidentally push your service_role key to GitHub, you'll get a notification email, and your keys will automatically be rolled on Supabase. For private repos you can disable this.

## Community Day

[PostgREST 10 pre-release](/blog/community-day#postgrest-10-pre-release), new OAuth providers, Next-JS auth helpers, new courses, and an open source Partner Gallery.

## Should I open source my company?

[We wrote an article](/blog/should-i-open-source-my-company) for anyone considoring making their codebase open source. We explore the advantages and tackle some common concerns.

## Supabrew - Never Code Thirsty

For April Fools - [we announced a non-alcoholic](/blog/supabrew), light, and refreshing brew. Perfect for coding late into the night. We're pushing the boundaries of Developer Experience.
