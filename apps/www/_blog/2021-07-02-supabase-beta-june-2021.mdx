## Vercel integration

Vercel just released their new integrations, which means you can now deploy a Postgres database on Supabase directly from your Vercel account.
Check it out! [vercel.com/integrations/supabase](https://vercel.com/integrations/supabase)

## Discord logins are now available

Building a community? There's almost no better tool than Discord (we're even trialling it ourselves).
If you're building a community product, Discord logins are the perfect option.

## New Guides

We spent the month building up a new [Guides section](/docs/guides) in our Docs. Here are a few highlights:

### Postgres Full Text Search

Ever wanted to build a Search Engine? We just released a guide which shows you how to implement
[Full Text Search using Postgres](/docs/guides/database/full-text-search).

### OAuth Guides

We released step-by-step guides to help you set up OAuth with
[Apple](/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-apple),
[Bitbucket](/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-bitbucket),
[Facebook](/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-facebook),
[GitHub](/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-github),
[GitLab](/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-gitlab),
[Google](/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-google), and
[Twitter](/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-twitter).

### Javascript + Postgres

Did you know that you can use Javascript inside your Postgres database? Here's how, with the
[`plv8` extension](/docs/guides/database/extensions/plv8).

## Public Storage Buckets

Want to share all your favourite memes? Now it's even easier with Public Storage Buckets. Simply mark a bucket as
"Public" and the content will be accessible without a login.

## Storage upserts

Supabase Storage now supports `upsert`. Shoutout to [@ankitjena](https://github.com/ankitjena) for
[this Pull Request](https://github.com/supabase/storage-api/pull/32).

## Server restarts

When things go wrong, sometime the best thing you can do is reboot. We released a restart button in the Dashboard,
the first of many debugging tools we'll be releasing over the next few months.

## Policy editor

We added a new Table Policy Editor which makes Row Level Security even easier. We even included a few templates to get you started.

## Build in Public

We run a weekly 1-hour live stream where we build in public.
