We have just concluded [Launch Week 15 with so many new updates](https://supabase.com/launch-week), but no launch week is complete without a hackathon! The Supabase Launch Week 15 Hackathon begins now! Open your favorite IDE or AI agent and start building!

As of the time of publishing this blog post, the hackathon has begun and will conclude on Sunday, July 27th, at 11:59 pm PT. You could win an extremely limited edition Supabase swag and add your name to the Supabase Hackathon Hall of Fame.

For some inspiration, check out all the [winners from previous hackathons](https://supabase.com/blog/tags/hackathon).

This is the perfect excuse to "Build in a weekend, scale to millions.” Since you retain all the rights to your submissions, you can use the hackathon as a launch pad for your new Startup ideas, side projects, or indie hacks.
