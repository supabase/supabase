Here are the top 10 launches from the past week. _You won't believe #7._

Supabase Cron is a new Postgres module for creating and managing recurring tasks. It is deeply integrated with the rest of the Supabase toolset.

## #3: Edge Functions: Background Tasks, Ephemeral Storage, and WebSockets

A feature tri-fecta: Edge Functions now support Websockets for things like OpenAI's Realtime API, ephemeral storage for things like zip files, and Background Tasks that continue to run after you've sent a response to your users.

## #4: CLI v2: Config as Code

We realeased v2 of the CLI, adding support for Configuration as Code. You can now use the CLI in your GitHub actions to keep all of your project configuration in sync.

## #5: High Performance Disks

With advanced disks you can store up to 60 TB of data with 100x improved durability, and provision up to 5x more IOPS than the default disks we offer.

## #6: Restore to a new Project

You can now launch new projects from the backups of any of your existing projects. This is particularly helpful if you want to do some data engineering without impacting your production database.

## #7: Bring your own LLM: database.build

"postgres.new" is now ["database.build"](https://database.build) and you can still run everything in your own browser. We've added 3 major features: Bring-your-own-LLM, Live Share, and they ability to deploy your [pglite](https://pglite.dev/) to Supabase.

## #8: Oriole Beta7 - high performance Postgres

We're building a new storage engine for Postgres that's much faster than the current storage engine. We've released some benchmarks and made it available on the Platform.

## #10: Mega Launch Week

This Launch Week is special because we didn't do it alone. This time, more than 20 other devtools joined us to launch their products and features throughout the week. Some things are just more fun when you do them together.
