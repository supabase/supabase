We have two big product announcements this month, new integrations with products we love, and exciting highlights from our amazing community.

We're also absolutely stoked to let you know that we've hit a massive milestone: [50k GitHub Stars](https://github.com/supabase/supabase)! ðŸŒŸ. Much love to everyone who helped us get there!

## Supabase Vector: the open source Vector Toolkit for Postgres

![Supabase Vector: the open source Vector Toolkit for Postgres](/images/blog/2023-09-06-may-2023-beta-update/supabase-vector.png)

Storing vector embeddings in Postgres with `pgvector` is becoming increasingly popular for AI applications, so we're building out a collection of tools to store, index, and query embeddings at scale.

## Vault is now available for all projects

Vault is a Postgres extension and accompanying Supabase UI that makes it safe and easy to store encrypted secrets and other data in your database.

## Auth Helpers now include server-side Auth and full support for the Next.js App Router

We have updated the [Next.js Auth Helpers package](https://github.com/supabase/auth-helpers) to make it available across the client and server of the App Router. They also now implement server-side auth by default with PKCE - meaning the entire auth flow is now possible server-side.

## Improving our dashboard with user feedback

As we plan the next few months of Dashboard development, we're reaching out to users to see all the different ways people use the Dashboard in their work.

Last month, we opened up a public [RFC for the Dashboard SQL Editor](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/14206). It's been amazing to see how people use this tool to build their projects. If you're a heavy user of the SQL Editor, we'd love to get your feedback.

We also started doing user interviews to understand how users use the Dashboard. Our goal is to build the best possible Dashboard for all of our users, and you can help! Reach out to [Terry](https://twitter.com/saltcod) you would like to share your experience.
