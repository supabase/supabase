This is a test blog post about FizzBuzz.

### What is FizzBuzz?

FizzBuzz is a classic programming challenge often used in coding interviews. The rules are simple:

- Print numbers from 1 to 100
- For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number
- For multiples of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number
- For multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz"

### Example Output

```
