Happy New Year! Hope you are off to a great start. We closed 2022 on a high note with [Launch Week 6](https://supabase.com/launch-week) and a cascade of announcements. Here is everything we shipped so you can try them all üíª

## Day 1: New Docs

![Day 1: New Docs](/images/blog/2023-01-05-december-beta-update/docs.jpg)

Documentation is super important to us, it's part of the product, and the Supabase docs needed a refresh. That's why we worked on a new redesign, better navigation, better reference docs, and we rebuilt the site using Next.js.

![Day 2: Storage v2 - Image resizing and Smart CDN](/images/blog/2023-01-05-december-beta-update/storage-v2-image-rezising.jpg)

We introduced three new features for Supabase Storage: Image resizing, webhooks, and a Smart CDN. These features are designed to work together to deliver a next-gen image resizing system.

We released Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) for everyone, including the option to enforce it via RLS üîê. Plus, in preparation for releasing SAML, we're "dogfooding" the feature with the introduction of Single Sign On (SSO) on our dashboard.

Foreign Data Wrappers are a core feature of PostgreSQL. With Supabase Wrappers, we've extended this feature to query other databases or any other external system (including third-party APIs), using SQL.

## Community Day

![Community Day](/images/blog/2023-01-05-december-beta-update/community.jpg)

It's starting to feel like Supabase is really just a "community of communities" ü§ó. Far too much has happened in the last 3 months for us to possibly feature it all here, so here's a collection of the highlights!
