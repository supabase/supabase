There‚Äôs something for everybody this month: AI, Auth, Database, Edge Functions, GraphQL ‚Ä¶ you name it!

## GraphiQL editor in the dashboard

IMAGE

The most popular GraphQL IDE/API explorer is now built into the dashboard! You can now explore and query your GraphQL API produced by `pg_graphql`.

[Try it now](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/api/graphiql).

## Supabase + OpenAI search

We've updated our Docs search functionality to use `pgvector` + OpenAI. Still no cease and desist from Microsoft, so you can continue to ask Clippy any Supabase-specific questions üìéüíö

## Made with Supabase

[Ask Clippy.](https://supabase.com/docs)




## Serve all the functions!

Do you use multiple Edge Functions in your project? Then celebrate! Supabase CLI 1.36+ now supports serving multiple Edge Functions at the same time.

To enable the feature, just run supabase functions serve in your project.

[Check the docs.](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/cli/supabase-functions-serve)

## Smaller Postgres docker images for everyone
IMAGE

We rewrote the Postgres Dockerfile with multi-stage builds so that each extension is compiled in its own separate stage. This reduces the size of the image from 1.3GB to 250MB, enabling a much faster boot time.

[See it yourself](https://hub.docker.com/r/supabase/postgres/tags)

## New UI for Postgres Roles
IMAGE

We've improved database role management. You can create, update, and delete database roles through the dashboard. Just one small step towards column-level security

[Check it out.](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/editor)

## API docs in the table editor

API docs got a light touchup and were moved to the table editor. You can now look up API methods and generate & download type files right there ‚ú®

## Quick product updates

- **Postgres Extensions**: We're rolling out some fixes for several Postgres extensions. Check your Dashboard notifications to see if you need to take any actions.

- **Auth**: Added full OpenAPI 3.0 spec which provides a comprehensive overview of the API with documentation on each request. [PR](https://github.com/supabase/gotrue/pull/918)

- **Database**: supabase-js now infers the response type from your query. If the inferred type is incorrect, you can use `.returns<MyType>()` to override it. [Doc](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/db-returns)

- **Dashboard**: Improved database roles management, you can now create, update and delete database roles through the dashboard. [Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/database/roles)

- **Dashboard**: We've provided a reference panel showing all available paths that can be queried from each respective source that improves the Logs Explorer experience. [Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/logs/explorer)

-¬†**Edge Functions**: upgraded to Deno 1.30.3, that supports TypeScript 4.9.x and introduces `satisfies`. Thanks to [Benjamin Dobell](https://github.com/Benjamin-Dobell) üôè. [PR](https://github.com/supabase/functions-relay/pull/30)

- Realtime: Broadcast only primary key(s) for deleting records when RLS is enabled and replica identity is full. [PR](https://github.com/supabase/realtime/pull/461)
