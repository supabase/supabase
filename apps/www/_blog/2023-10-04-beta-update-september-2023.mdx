We‚Äôve come a long way since our first update email in April 2020. We‚Äôve gone from 6 hosted databases on our platform to over 650,000 (and that doesn‚Äôt even include [database branches](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-local-dev). As always we‚Äôve had another hectic month of shipping fast, and community involvement in our [open source repos](https://github.com/supabase/supabase), meaning we can iterate on Supabase faster than ever. Here‚Äôs a small sample of some of the things we shipped during September‚Ä¶

## Broadcast realtime messages via REST API

![Broadcast realtime messages via REST API](https://obuldanrptloktxcffvn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/marketing-emails/september2023/sep1.png)

You can now broadcast Realtime messages to all your connected users by simply using a REST API call, removing the need to connect to a WebSocket. This will be especially useful with our Edge Functions!

## Supavisor is now used for connection pooling in all new projects

![Supavisor is now used for connection pooling in all new projects](https://obuldanrptloktxcffvn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/marketing-emails/september2023/sep2.png)

Less than two months ago, we announced Supavisor, our own Postgres connection pooler that handles millions of connections. It‚Äôs now available in all new projects. You can continue using pgbouncer alongside Supavisor, however, it will be deprecated effective January 15th, 2024.

### Moving to IPV6 for Database Connection Strings

With IPv4 addresses becoming increasingly scarce and [cloud providers starting to charge](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-public-ipv4-address-charge-public-ip-insights/) for it, we won‚Äôt be assigning IPv4 addresses to Supabase projects from January 15th, 2024. `[db.projectref.supabase.co](http://db.projectref.supabase.co)` will start resolving to a IPv6 address instead. If you plan on connecting to your database directly, you must ensure that your network can communicate over IPv6. Supavisor will continue to return IPv4 addresses, so you can update your applications to connect to Supavisor instead.

## New Foreign Data Wrapper: Airtable

![New Foreign Data Wrapper: Airtable](https://obuldanrptloktxcffvn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/marketing-emails/september2023/sep3.png?t=2023-10-03T11%3A36%3A04.651Z)

Introducing the latest addition to our Wrappers lineup: Airtable! You can use it to query data from your Airtable bases and tables directly from Postgres:

```sql
select * from my_airtable_table;
# data from Airtable
```

## HNSW Support for Vecs + pgvector

![HNSW Support for Vecs + pgvector](https://obuldanrptloktxcffvn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/marketing-emails/september2023/supabase-vector?t=2023-10-03T11%3A39%3A09.327Z)

Added HNSW support inside Vecs, our Python library for `pgvector`. Vecs automatically creates schemas and collections inside your database, making it one of the easiest ways to get started with `pgvector`.
