You will be asked to send a link to a GitHub (or similar) repo, in the README you should include:

- link to hosted demo (if applicable)
- list of team members GitHub handles (and Twitter if they have one)
- any demo videos, instructions, or memes

### Judges

We have assembled an All Star Judging Panel:

- [@themarcusbattle](https://twitter.com/themarcusbattle)
- The Supabase Team
- One more Mystery Guest

They will be looking for a few things, including:

- creativity/inventiveness
- functions correctly/smoothly
- visually pleasing
- technically impressive
- use of Supabase features
  - deep usage of a single feature or
  - broad usage are both ok
- FUN! ðŸ˜ƒ

### Rules

- Team size 1-5 (all team members on winning teams will receive a prize)
- You cannot be in multiple teams
- One submission per team
- All design elements, code, etc. for your project must be created **during** the event
- All entries must be Open Source (link to source code required in entry)
- Must use Supabase in some capacity
- Can be any language or framework
- You must submit before the deadline (no late entries)
- You can continue to make updates to your project after the submission deadline, but there is no guarantee that the judges will see additions made after the submission time.
