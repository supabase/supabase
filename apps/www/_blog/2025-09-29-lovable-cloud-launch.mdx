Yesterday, Lovable announced [**Lovable Cloud**,](https://lovable.dev/cloud) making building with AI agents easier than ever. Every project created in Lovable Cloud is powered by Supabase behind the scenes. That means every AI builder using Lovable is already using Supabase, whether or not they realize it.

Lovable's mission is to abstract away the backend so developers can focus on ideas and execution. Supabase's mission is to provide the most complete Postgres development platform in the world. Together, these two approaches are changing how people build software.

## Why this matters

Supabase has become the default choice for AI builders. Whether it's Lovable Cloud or the next breakthrough product, the pattern is the same: when speed and scale both matter, Supabase is the foundation.

- **Build fast.** AI-assisted development requires instant setup and minimal friction. Supabase delivers that with a fully managed Postgres Database, integrated Auth, Storage, Edge Functions, and Realtime APIs.
- **Scale with confidence.** AI builders can't afford to stall at prototype stage. Supabase scales from weekend projects to millions of users, with Row Level Security, point-in-time recovery, read replicas, and enterprise compliance baked in.
- **Stay open and flexible.** Supabase is just Postgres. That means builders aren't locked into proprietary query languages or one-way migrations. They can extend their stack with Foreign Data Wrappers, pgvector, and the broader Postgres ecosystem.

## Lovable Cloud, powered by Supabase

Lovable focuses on simplicity: give developers a clean interface to build AI-powered applications without worrying about infrastructure. Supabase provides that infrastructure. The thousands of projects Lovable launches every day run on Supabase because we provide the security, reliability, and developer experience they need.

- **For developers,** Lovable Cloud offers a polished, AI-first interface. Underneath, Supabase ensures every project has a proven, scalable backend.
- **For enterprises,** this partnership proves that Supabase is trusted by the fastest-moving innovators. Lovable's growth shows the demand for AI-native development, and Supabase is the platform making it possible.

Supabase is the open-source Postgres development platform trusted by over 4.5 million developers worldwide. Every day, more than 40,000 new databases are launched on Supabase. AI builders like Lovable and Bolt aren't choosing Supabase by accident. They're choosing it because the combination of speed, reliability, and scale is unmatched. Lovable Cloud is another proof point: when the next generation of developer tools launches, Supabase is the default platform that powers them.

## Start building

Whether you're building with Lovable or directly on Supabase, the foundation is the same: a complete Postgres development platform that lets you move fast without compromise.
