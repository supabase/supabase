So when we started planning Launch Week 6 planning, we brainstormed ideas for a viral campaign and we came with the concept of a Content Storm â›ˆ.

## What is the Content Storm?

We set up to get as many external content creators as possible to create Supabase-related content and publish everything on the same day. We worked with some  well known creators, but also invited the SupaSquad, community members, and makers that are using Suabase to build great apps.
