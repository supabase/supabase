Here at Supabase, we always try to innovate and reinvent the playbook, so when we started planning [Launch Week 6](https://supabase.com/launch-week), we brainstormed ideas for a campaign to promote it that would involve the community. We took a bit of inspiration from things like Weezer‚Äôs youtube takeover came up with the concept of a Content Storm ‚õà.

## What is the Content Storm?

We set up to get as many external content creators as possible to create Supabase-related content and *publish everything on the same day*. We got in touch with lots of people: some well known Youtubers, but also community members, makers building with Supabase, the SupaSquad, and others... we wanted this to be an opportunity for them to build their personal brand or promote their products and startups.

## The aftermath of the storm

More than 30 creators participated in creating content in different formats and everything was published today (Tuesday 6th of December). Here is the full list of every piece of content and its author:
