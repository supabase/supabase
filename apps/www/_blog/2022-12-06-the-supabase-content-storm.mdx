Here at Supabase, we always try to innovate and reinvent the marketing playbook, so when we started planning Launch Week 6, we brainstormed ideas for a viral campaign and we came with the concept of a Content Storm ‚õà.

## What is the Content Storm?

We set up to get as many external content creators as possible to create Supabase-related content and publish everything on the same day. We worked with some  well known creators, but also invited the SupaSquad, community members, and makers that are using Suabase to build great apps.

## The aftermath of the storm

More than 30 creators participated in creating content in different formats and were published during the day. Here is the full list of everything that was published and the authors:
