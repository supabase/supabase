The [Launch Week 12](https://supabase.com/launch-week) brought us a whole new set of Supabase features to build with. And to showcase what developers can build with Supabase, we announced the [Launch Week 12 hackathon](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-lw12-hackathon) a while back, and it’s finally time to announce the winners!

The entire Supabase team had the pleasure of going through each amazing project, and we were so impressed with the quality of them. You can check out all of the submissions [here](https://www.hackathon.dev/lw12). Now, without a further ado, let’s take a look at the winners!
