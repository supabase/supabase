**UPDATE 16/08/2022**: supabase-js v2 is out and focuses on “quality-of-life” improvements for developers. V2 includes Type support, new auth methods, realtime multiplayer sneak peek, and more: [**Read the blog post**](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-js-v2)

### New Docs

Before digging into the improvements, we're excited to point out our new [developer docs](/docs/reference/javascript/installing). While they're still a work in progress, here are some things we think you'll like:

- The [Reference Docs](/docs/reference/javascript/installing) are auto-generated from our TypeScript definitions and then enriched with examples. This forces us to document our code and makes it easier to keep everything in sync.
- We added placeholders for the other languages that the community is developing. They have already started with Python, C#, Dart, Rust, and Swift. Expect to see the docs filling up soon!
- We've added sections for all of the open source tools we use, including [Postgres](/docs/postgres/server/about), PostgREST[^1], [GoTrue](/docs/gotrue/server/about), and Realtime[^2]. We'll be filling these with lots of valuable information including self-hosting, benchmarks, and simple guides.

### Errors are returned, not thrown

We attribute this improvement to community feedback. This has significantly improved the developer experience.

Previously we would throw errors:

```js
try {
  const { body } = supabase.from('todos').select('*')
} catch (error) {
  console.log(error)
}
```

And now we simply return them:

```js
const { data, error } = supabase.from('todos').select('*')
if (error) console.log(error)\n
// else, carry on ..
```

After testing this for a while we're very happy with this pattern. Errors are handled next to the offending function. Of course you can always rethrow the error if that's your preference.

### We created `gotrue-js`

Our goal for `supabase-js` is to tie together many sub-libraries. Each sub-library is a standalone implementation for a single external system. This is one of the ways we support existing open source tools.

To maintain this philosophy, we created [`gotrue-js`](https://github.com/supabase/gotrue-js), a library for Netlify's GoTrue auth server. This library includes a number of new additions, including third-party logins.

Previously:

```js
const {
  body: { user },
} = await supabase.auth.signup('someone@email.com', 'password')
```

Now:

```js
const { user, error } = await supabase.auth.signUp({
  email: 'someone@email.com',
  password: 'password',
})
```

### Enhancements and fixes

- Native TypeScript. All of our libraries are now natively built with TypeScript: [`supabase-js`](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js), [`postgrest-js`](https://github.com/supabase/postgrest-js), [`gotrue-js`](https://github.com/supabase/gotrue-js), and [`realtime-js`](https://github.com/supabase/realtime-js).
- Better realtime scalability: we only generate one socket connection per Supabase client. Previously we would create a connection for every subscription.
- We've added support for OAuth providers.
- 60% of minor bugs outstanding for `supabase-js` have been [solved](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js/pull/50).
- You can use `select()` instead of `select(*)`

### Breaking changes

We've bumped the major version because there are a number of breaking changes. We've detailed these in the [release notes](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js/releases/tag/v1.0.1), but here are a few to be aware of:

- `signup()` is now `signUp()` and `email` / `password` is passed as an object
- `logout()` is now `signOut()`
- `login()` is now `signIn()`
- `ova()` and `ovr()` are now just `ov()`
- `body` is now `data`

Previously:

```js
const { body } = supabase.from('todos').select('*')
```

Now:

```js
const { data } = supabase.from('todos').select()
```

### Upgrading

We have documented all of the changes in the [release notes](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js/releases/tag/v1.0.1).

To summarise the steps:

1. Install the new version: `npm install @supabase/supabase-js@latest`
2. Update all your `body` constants to `data`
3. Update all your `supabase.auth` functions with the new [Auth interface](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signup)
