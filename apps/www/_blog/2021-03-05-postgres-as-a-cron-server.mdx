A Supabase user asked recently if they can trigger a webhook periodically. We haven't yet released Functions yet, so we checked whether it's possible with Postgres.

It is. Here's how.

### What's cron?

A "cron job" is a script[^1] that runs periodically at fixed times, dates, or intervals. Traditionally you'd set it up on a Linux server. An example might be an hourly script that downloads emails to your computer.

[^1]: Not necessarily a script. The cron is really a scheduler which triggers a job (of some sort, usually a bash script).

These days, cron jobs are set up on a remote servers and in the cloud to run internet-related tasks. Like checking an endpoint every hour, or scraping a website every day.

### Postgres + cron

Postgres has "extensions" which allow you to, well, extend the database with "non-core" features. Extensions essentially turn Postgres into an application server.

The team at [Citus](https://github.com/citusdata) created [`pg_cron`](https://github.com/citusdata/pg_cron) to run periodic jobs within your Postgres database.

#### Enabling the extension

If you're using a cloud-hosted Postgres database, make sure that `pg_cron` is installed first. The easiest way to do this is to run this command:

```sql
select name, comment, default_version, installed_version
from pg_available_extensions
where name = 'pg_cron';
```

If it returns a result then the extension is supported and you can turn it on by running:

```sql
create extension if not exists pg_cron;
```

If you're using Supabase you can also enable it in the Dashboard.

#### Granting access to the extension

If you're planning to use a `non-superuser` role to schedule jobs, ensure that they are granted access to the `cron` schema and its underlying objects beforehand.

```sql
grant usage on schema cron to {{DB user}};
grant all privileges on all tables in schema cron to {{DB user}};
```

Failure to do so would result in jobs by these roles to not run at all.

### Postgres + webhooks

The Supabase customer wanted to call external endpoints every day. How would we do this? Another extension of course. This time we're going to use [pgsql-http](https://github.com/pramsey/pgsql-http) by [@pramsey](https://github.com/pramsey). Using the same technique, we can enable the extension (if it exists in your cloud provider).

```sql
create extension if not exists http;
```

This extension can now be used for [sending](https://github.com/pramsey/pgsql-http#functions) `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` requests.

For example, this function would get all the people in Star Wars (using the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev)):

```sql
select content::json->'results'
from http_get('https://swapi.dev/api/people');
```

### Postgres + cron + webhooks

Now the fun stuff. For this example we're going to call [webhook.site](https://webhook.site) every minute with the payload `{ "hello": "world" }`.

Here's the code (with comments `--like this`).

```sql
select
  cron.schedule(
    'webhook-every-minute', -- name of the cron job
    '* * * * *', -- every minute
    $$
    select status
    from
      http_post(
        'https://webhook.site/223c8a43-725b-4cbd-b1fe-d0da73353a6b', -- webhook URL, replace the ID(223c8..) with your own
        '{"hello": "world"}', -- payload
        'application/json'
      )
    $$
  );
```

Now when we see that the payload is sent every minute, exactly on the minute.

![This image shows the website that receives our webhook every minute.](/images/blog/website-hook.jpeg)

And that's it! We've built a cron webhook. Breaking down the code example above we have 2 key parts:

#### POSTing data

This is the part that sends the data to the website:

```sql
select status
from
  http_post(
    'https://webhook.site/223c8a43-725b-4cbd-b1fe-d0da73353a6b', -- webhook URL
    '{"hello": "world"}', -- payload
    'application/json'
  )
```

#### Scheduling the job

The HTTP function is wrapped with the CRON scheduler:

```sql
select
  cron.schedule(
    'cron-name', -- name of the cron job
    '* * * * *', -- every minute
    $$
     -- Put your code between two dollar signs so that you can create full statements.
     -- Alternatively, you can write you code in a Postgres Function and call it here.
    $$
  );
```

The second parameter uses cron syntax:

```sh
 ┌───────────── min (0 - 59)
 │ ┌────────────── hour (0 - 23)
 │ │ ┌─────────────── day of month (1 - 31)
 │ │ │ ┌──────────────── month (1 - 12)
 │ │ │ │ ┌───────────────── day of week (0 - 6) (0 to 6 are Sunday to
 │ │ │ │ │                  Saturday, or use names; 7 is also Sunday)
 * * * * *
```

If you're unfamiliar with the cron syntax, useful shortcuts can be found on [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru/)

```sh
* * * * *       # every minute
*/5 * * * *     # every 5th minute
0 * * * *       # every hour
0 0 * * *       # every day
```

#### Managing your cron jobs

To see a list of all your cron jobs, run:

```sql
select * from cron.job;
```

And if you need to see the results of each cron iterations, you can find them in `cron.job_run_details`:

```sql
select * from cron.job_run_details;
```

To stop a running cron job, you can run:

```sql
select cron.unschedule('webhook-every-minute'); -- pass the name of the cron job
```

### What can I do with this?

There are plenty use-cases for this. For example:

- **Sending welcome emails.** If you use an email provider with an HTTP API, then you batch emails to that service. Write a function that `selects` all your signups yesterday, then sends them to your favorite transactional email service. Schedule it every day to run at midnight.
- **Aggregating data.** If you're providing analytical data, you might want to aggregate it into time periods for faster querying (which serves a similar purpose as a [Materialized View](/blog/postgresql-views#materialized-views-vs-conventional-views)).
- **Deleting old data.** Need to free up space? Run a scheduled job to delete data you no longer need.

See a detailed list in the [`pg_cron` README](https://github.com/citusdata/pg_cron#example-use-cases).

## Addendum

### Postgres background workers

You might have noticed [this](https://github.com/pramsey/pgsql-http#why-this-is-a-bad-idea) notice the warning at the bottom of the `http` readme:

> "What happens if the web page takes a long time to return?" Your SQL call will just wait there until it does. Make sure your web service fails fast.

Luckily pg_cron implements [Background Workers](https://paquier.xyz/postgresql-2/postgres-9-3-feature-highlight-custom-background-workers/):

> Care is taken that these extra processes do not interfere with other postmaster tasks: only one such process is started on each ServerLoop iteration. This means a large number of them could be waiting to be started up and postmaster is still able to quickly service external connection requests.

This means that even if your endpoint takes a long time to return, it's not going to be blocking your core Postgres functions. Either way, you should probably only call endpoints that will return a response quickly, or set the http extension to fail fast (`http.timeout_msec = 300`).

If you're familiar with `C`, you could also help `@pramsey` to implement async functions: https://github.com/pramsey/pgsql-http/issues/105

### Should I use Postgres as a cron server?

There are plenty of ways to run cron jobs these days. You can trigger them from your local machine. You can install them on a VPS. You can schedule Serverless functions. You can use a paid service. You can use GitHub Actions.

Is Postgres the best place to put your cron jobs? `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`. Postgres databases are free on Supabase and since it takes only one minute to [get started](https://app.supabase.com/), why not make your next cron server a Postgres database?
