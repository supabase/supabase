# What's new in pg_graphql 1.5.7

Since our [last check-in on pg_graphql](/blog/whats-new-in-pg-graphql-v1-2) there have been a few quality of life improvements worth calling out. A quick roundup of the key differences includes:

- Pagination via First/Offset
- Schema based multi-tenancy
- Filtering on array typed columns with `contains`, `containedBy` and `overlaps`

## First/Offset pagination

Since the earliest days of pg_graphql, [keyset pagination](https://supabase.github.io/pg_graphql/api/#keyset-pagination) has been supported. Keyset pagination allows for paging forwards and backwards through a collection by specifying a number of records and the unique id of a record within the collection. For example:

```graphql
{
  blogCollection(
    first: 2,
    after: "Y3Vyc29yMQ=="
  ) {
  ...
}
```

to retrieve the first 2 records after the record with unique id `Y3Vyc29yMQ==` .

Starting in version `1.5.0` there is support for `offset` based pagination, which is based on skipping `offset` number of records before returning the results.

```graphql
{
  blogCollection(
    first: 2,
    offset: 5
  ) {
  ...
}
```

That is roughly equivalent to the SQL

```graphql
select
    *
from
    blog
limit
    2
offset
    5
```

In general as offset values increase, the performance of the query will decrease. For that reason its important to use keyset pagination where possible.

## Performance schema based multi-tennancy

pg_graphql caches the database schema on first query and rebuilds that cache any time the schema changes. The cache key is a combination of the postgres role and the database schema's version number. Initially, the structure of all schemas was loaded for all roles, and table/column visibility was filtered down within `pg_graphql`.

In multi-tenant environments with 1 schema per tenant, that meant every time a tenant updated their schema, all tenants had to rebuild the cache. When the number of tenants gets large, that burdens the database if its under heavy load.

Following version `1.5.2` each tenant's cache only loads the schemas that they have `usage` permission for, which greatly reduces the query time in multi-tenant environments and the size of the schema cache. At time of writing this solution powers a project with >2200 tenants.

## Filtering array column types

From `1.5.6` pg_graphql has added `contains`, `containedBy`, `overlaps` filter operators for scalar array fields like `text[]` or `int[]`.

For example, given a table

```sql
create table blog (
  id int primary key,
  name text not null,
  tags text[] not null,
  created_at timestamp not null
);
```

the `tags` column with type `text[]` can be filtered on.

```graphql
{
  blogCollection(filter: { tags: { contains: ["tech", "innovation"] } }) {
    edges {
      cursor
      node {
        name
        tags
        createdAt
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In this case, the result set is filtered to records where the `tags` column contains both `tech` and `innovation`.

## Roadmap

The headline features we aim to launch in coming releases of pg_graphql include support for:

- Insert on conflict / Upsert
- Nested inserts
