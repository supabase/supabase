We've been building for 9 months now, and we're getting even closer to Beta.

### Add users

You can now add users manually from your dashboard.

### User admin

You can also perform admin functions on existing users - send password reset emails, magic links, and delete users.

### Even more powerful SQL Editor

Last month we [announced](/blog/supabase-alpha-october-2020#more-powerful-sql-editor) an improved SQL Editor, and this month we've taken it even further. The SQL Editor is now a full Monaco editor, like you'd find in VS Code. Build your database directly from the browser.

### Status page

We added a [Status Page](https://status.supabase.com/) which tracks the uptime and latency of the Supabase platform.

### Kaizen

- We completed a security audit by DigitalXRAID.
- Email confirmations now enabled by default for signups.
- Updated [Benchmarking Suite](https://github.com/supabase/benchmarks/) to include more realistic workloads, on various different servers (results published soon).
- You can now set/edit/remove Foreign Keys via the table editor.
