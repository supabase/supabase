This month we welcome [Steve Chavez](https://github.com/steve-chavez) to the team. Steve is a maintainer of PostgREST, one of the core tools which makes Supabase possible.

Steve and I have been in contact since he [added one of my old blog posts](https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest-docs/commit/3dde972d31519d3afc319015bce1dc0f73adeb8e#commitcomment-35312841) to the PostgREST docs. He has a rich history in open source and we're excited to have him in our team.

Steve is helping us build one of our most demanded features - our Auth system. We will support him to build some exciting features which he has planned for PostgREST, including enhanced PostGIS support.
