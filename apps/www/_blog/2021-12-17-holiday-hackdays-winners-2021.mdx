To cool down from [our latest launch week](/blog/beta-november-2021-launch-week-recap) we (virtually) [sat down with y'all](https://youtu.be/TijBVcV4jXw) and started hacking, and once again we absolutely loved your hackathon submissions and are excited to send some extremely limited swag your way!

As always, it was challenging to pick the winners from all the great submissions! You can see all the amazing projects submitted on [madewithsupabase.com](https://www.madewithsupabase.com/holiday-hackdays). And now, without further ado, let's look at some of our favourites in more detail:

## Best Overall Project

### Winner

[Swappy.one](https://github.com/zernonia/swappy-one) - by [@zernonia](https://twitter.com/zernonia)

Zernonia is one of our [SupaSquad](https://supabase.com/supasquad) members and continuously blows our minds with his creativity for the open-source projects he creates. For example, he's also the mastermind behind [madewithsupabase.com](https://www.madewithsupabase.com/), one of our favourite resources to see what y'all are building.

Now he can add a gold tee to his collection, and we're starting to run out of swag ideas to show our appreciation! (Send us some ideas on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/supabase)!)

### Runner Up

[Chivel](https://github.com/lalit2005/chivel) - by [@lalitcodes](https://twitter.com/lalitcodes) and [@ChapagainAshik](https://twitter.com/ChapagainAshik)

Chivel is a tool to quickly generate a landing page for your YouTube channel. For example check out this snazzy page that they've generated for the Supabase channel: [supabase.chivel.tk](https://supabase.chivel.tk/)!

A great idea that deserves some silver tees!

## Best Realtime Project

### Winner

[rtPoll](https://github.com/emilioschepis/rtpoll) - by [@emilioschepis](https://twitter.com/emilioschepis) & brother Federico.

Brothers Emilio and Federico built a platform to quickly create polls and share them around. Seeing poll results is great, but you know what's even better? Exactly, seeing poll results in realtime!

### Runner Up

[e2ee-chat](https://github.com/arnu515/supabase-e2ee-chat) - by [@arnu5152](https://twitter.com/arnu5152)

A chat app is a fairly obvious use case for realtime syncing, but this project caught our eye because the chat is end-to-end encrypted!

## Best Christmas Themed

This team of high school hackers just keeps knocking it out of the park again. In our [Hacktoberfest Hackathon](https://supabase.com/blog/hacktoberfest-hackathon-winners-2021#most-spookyfun) they already made it onto the podium. This time around they built this stunning greeting card platform that lets you send well wishes to your friends around the globe in no time. We love it!
