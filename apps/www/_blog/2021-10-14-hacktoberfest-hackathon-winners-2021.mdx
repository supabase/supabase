Hacktoberfest is in full swing and we've been blown away by [all the incredible projects]() submitted to our second open-source Hackathon.

We've picked our top ten favourite projects across five categories, and believe us, it was a tough decision to make!

Since all submissions were so stellar, we've decided to reward everyone with a [limited edition participation tee](https://store.supabase.com/products/hacktoberfest-participation-tee).

Now, let us introduce the winner and runner up for each category, and see below for the even more limited edition swag they've won!

Lastly, remember that all projects are open-source, so do check them out and spend the second half of Hacktoberfest contributing to your favourite projects!

This project by a group of high school students gave us the feel good vibes.

How freaking cool is that?!
