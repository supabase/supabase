Hacktoberfest is in full swing and we've been blown away by [all the incredible projects]() submitted to our second open-source Hackathon.

We've picked our top ten favourite projects across five categories, and believe us, it was a tough decision to make!

Since all submissions were so stellar, we've decided to reward everyone with a [limited edition participation tee](https://supabase.store/products/hacktoberfest-participation-tee).

Now, let us introduce the winner and runner up for each category, and see below for the even more limited edition swag they've won!

Lastly, remember that all projects are open-source, so do check them out and spend the second half of Hacktoberfest contributing to your favourite projects!

This project by a group of high school students gave us the feel good vibes. On the one hand with their awesome website that conveniently lets you log your daily vibes and check in on your friends', and on the other hand because high school students are building brilliant things with Supabase. How freaking cool is that?!
