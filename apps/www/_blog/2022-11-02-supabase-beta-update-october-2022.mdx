During October, we shipped something for everybody: new SDKs, quickstarts, Functions tricks, and more. All are listed here just for you. But, more importantly, Launch Week 6️⃣ has a date!

## supabase-js v2 and supabase-flutter v1 released

## New Next.js quickstart & Next.js 13 example

Next.js is all the rage right now 🔥

Next.js Conf raised the bar for dev conferences. We had the honor of being a Gold Sponsor, so we revamped our [Next.js Quickstart guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/with-nextjs) to include our pre-built Auth UI and [Auth Helpers.](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-helpers/nextjs)

And Next.js 13 was announced! Making it extremely easy to fetch and cache data from our [Serverless API](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/api). So we put together an [example to try it out](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/tree/master/examples/caching/with-nextjs-13).

## Supabase Auth and Server-Side Rendering

![Supabase Auth and Server-Side Rendering](/images/blog/2022-october/authentication-server-side-docs.jpg)

The Auth team published an in-depth doc explaining how Supabase Auth supports server-side rendering. Includes an explanation of the authentication flow and answers to some of the more common questions.

[Read the docs](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/server-side-rendering).

## Database Testing with pgTAP

Do you have 100% code coverage? Probably not, because that’s usually the last thing you think of, but _definitely_ not if you don’t have database tests. We just shipped a framework for Database Tests which makes it incredibly easy to test your database using pgTAP and pg_prove.

[Learn how it works](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/testing).

## Edge Functions Update

![Edge Functions Update](/images/blog/2022-october/functions-new-methods.jpg)

Functions now support GET requests! Other HTTP verbs such as PUT, PATCH, and DELETE are supported too.

[Check this example](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/master/examples/edge-functions/supabase/functions/restful-tasks/index.ts)

## Quick Product Updates

- supabase-py 🐍 now has functions support! [PR](https://github.com/supabase-community/supabase-py/pull/179)
- You can now detect users’ location from Edge Functions easily by using `X-Forwarded-For header`. [Example](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/tree/master/examples/edge-functions/supabase/functions/location)
- Return `provider_refresh_token` along with `provider_access_token`. [PR](https://github.com/supabase/gotrue/pull/641)
- Added a `refreshSession` method to allow users to forcefully refresh a session instead of waiting for it to autorefresh upon expiry. Thanks to [@j4w8n](https://github.com/j4w8n) for the [PR](https://github.com/supabase/gotrue-js/pull/505) 🙇🏻‍♂️
- Logging: realtime, storage, postgrest, and pgbouncer released.
- Trigger a file download by adding the download query parameter to your storage objects. storage-api. [PR](https://github.com/supabase/storage-api/issues/122)
