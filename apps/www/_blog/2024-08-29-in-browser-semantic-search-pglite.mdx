A couple of weeks ago during [Launch Week 12](/blog/postgres-new) we introduced a new in-browser Postgres sandbox experience built in collaboration with the [ElectricSQL](https://electric-sql.com/) team utilizing [PGlite](https://github.com/electric-sql/pglite) to run Postgres and the pgvector extension in the browser.

This gave me the idea to try and build a fully local, in-browser [semantic search](/docs/guides/ai/semantic-search) experience, utilising

- PGlite to store text and embeddings locally in IndexedDB.
- pgvector to perform inner product search.
- Hunggingface's [Transformers.js](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/en/index) with [Supabase/gte-small](https://huggingface.co/Supabase/gte-small) to generate embeddings.

I'm thinking, something like this can be great for eCommerce sites that want to surface relevant products for user's searches quickly without needing a server roundtrip, or quickly showing similar products to the customer. Any other use cases you can think of? [Tweet them](https://x.com/supabase) at us!

Watch the video guide to see the demo in action, or test it out yourself in this [Huggingface Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/thorwebdev/pglite-semantic-search)!

## Install the dependencies

In this example we'll be using a simple static React application. If you're starting from scratch, you can use `vite create` to get started:

```bash
npm create vite@latest
```

Then go ahead and install the required dependencies: `@electric-sql/pglite` and `@huggingface/transformers`:

```bash
npm install @electric-sql/pglite @huggingface/transformers
```

## Create the Database schema

Next, create a `utils/db.js` file to set up the database schema:

```js utils/db.js
import { PGlite } from '@electric-sql/pglite'
import { vector } from '@electric-sql/pglite/vector'

let dbInstance
// Implement a singleton pattern to make sure we only create one database instance.
export async function getDB() {
  if (dbInstance) {
    return dbInstance
  }
  const metaDb = new PGlite('idb://supa-semantic-search', {
    extensions: {
      vector,
    },
  })
  await metaDb.waitReady
  dbInstance = metaDb
  return metaDb
}

// Initialize the database schema.
export const initSchema = async (db) => {
  return await db.exec(`
    create extension if not exists vector;
    -- drop table if exists embeddings; -- Uncomment this line to reset the database
    create table if not exists embeddings (
      id bigint primary key generated always as identity,
      content text not null,
      embedding vector (384)
    );
    
    create index on embeddings using hnsw (embedding vector_ip_ops);
  `)
}

// Helper method to count the rows in a table.
export const countRows = async (db, table) => {
  const res = await db.query(`SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ${table};`)
  return res.rows[0].count
}

// [...]
```

In your `App.jsx` file, set up the state and reference variables to set up the database:

```js App.jsx
import { getDB, initSchema, countRows } from './utils/db'
import { useState, useEffect, useRef, useCallback } from 'react'

export default function App() {
  const [content, setContent] = useState([])
  const initailizing = useRef(false)
  // Create a reference to the worker object.
  const worker = useRef(null)

  // Set up DB
  const db = useRef(null)
  useEffect(() => {
    const setup = async () => {
      initailizing.current = true
      db.current = await getDB()
      await initSchema(db.current)
      let count = await countRows(db.current, 'embeddings')

      if (count === 0) {
        // TODO: seed the database.
      }
      // Get Items
      const items = await db.current.query('SELECT content FROM embeddings')
      setContent(items.rows.map((x) => x.content))
    }
    if (!db.current && !initailizing.current) {
      setup()
    }
  }, [])

  // [...]

  return <pre>{JSON.stringify(content)}</pre>
}
```

## Seed the Database with text and embeddings

There are various ways of generating the embeddings to seed your database. For example you could use a [Database webhook]() in Supabase anytime a new item is inserted into the database. You can find an example for this [here]().

For easy prototyping, you can use [database.build](https://database.build) to generate sample data, including embeddings, and then copy and paste that into your application.

Add this `seedDB` method to your `utils/db.js` file:

```js utils/db.js
// [...]

export const seedDb = async (db) => {
  return await db.exec(`

## Define the inner product search function with pgvector

In PGlite we can use pgvector just like we would in Postgres. Here we create a inner product search function, that takes in three parameters:

- `embedding` - The embedding of our search term.
- `match_threshold` - The threshold for the inner product.
- `limit` - The number of results to return.

```js utils/db.js
// [...]

export const search = async (db, embedding, match_threshold = 0.8, limit = 3) => {
  const res = await db.query(
    `
    select * from embeddings

    -- The inner product is negative, so we negate match_threshold
    where embeddings.embedding <#> $1 < $2

    -- Our embeddings are normalized to length 1, so cosine similarity
    -- and inner product will produce the same query results.
    -- Using inner product which can be computed faster.
    --
    -- For the different distance functions, see https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector
    order by embeddings.embedding <#> $1
    limit $3;
    `,
    [JSON.stringify(embedding), -Number(match_threshold), Number(limit)]
  )
  return res.rows
}

// [...]
```

## Create an embedding for the search term

To generate the embedding for the search term, we set up a [web worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API) that creates our transformers pipeline and event listeners to communicate with the main thread.

```js worker.js
import { pipeline } from '@huggingface/transformers'

// Use the Singleton pattern to enable lazy construction of the pipeline.
class PipelineSingleton {
  static task = 'feature-extraction'
  static model = 'Supabase/gte-small'
  static instance = null

  static async getInstance(progress_callback = null) {
    if (this.instance === null) {
      this.instance = pipeline(this.task, this.model, {
        progress_callback,
        dtype: 'fp32',
        device: !!navigator.gpu ? 'webgpu' : 'wasm',
      })
    }
    return this.instance
  }
}

// Listen for messages from the main thread
self.addEventListener('message', async (event) => {
  // Retrieve the classification pipeline. When called for the first time,
  // this will load the pipeline and save it for future use.
  let classifier = await PipelineSingleton.getInstance((x) => {
    // We also add a progress callback to the pipeline so that we can
    // track model loading.
    self.postMessage(x)
  })

  // Actually perform the classification
  let output = await classifier(event.data.text, {
    pooling: 'mean',
    normalize: true,
  })

  // Extract the embedding output
  const embedding = Array.from(output.data)

  // Send the output back to the main thread
  self.postMessage({
    status: 'complete',
    embedding,
  })
})
```

In our `App.jsx` we set up a reference worker variable as well as the event listeners:

```js App.jsx
import { getDB, initSchema, countRows, seedDb, search } from './utils/db'
import { useState, useEffect, useRef, useCallback } from 'react'

export default function App() {
  // Keep track of the classification result and the model loading status.
  const [input, setInput] = useState('')
  const [content, setContent] = useState([])
  const [result, setResult] = useState(null)
  const [ready, setReady] = useState(null)
  const initailizing = useRef(false)

  // [...]

  // We use the `useEffect` hook to set up the worker as soon as the `App` component is mounted.
  useEffect(() => {
    if (!worker.current) {
      // Create the worker if it does not yet exist.
      worker.current = new Worker(new URL('./worker.js', import.meta.url), {
        type: 'module',
      })
    }

    // Create a callback function for messages from the worker thread.
    const onMessageReceived = async (e) => {
      switch (e.data.status) {
        case 'initiate':
          setReady(false)
          break
        case 'ready':
          setReady(true)
          break
        case 'complete':
          // Inner product search
          const searchResults = await search(db.current, e.data.embedding)
          console.log({ searchResults })
          setResult(searchResults.map((x) => x.content))
          break
      }
    }

    // Attach the callback function as an event listener.
    worker.current.addEventListener('message', onMessageReceived)

    // Define a cleanup function for when the component is unmounted.
    return () => worker.current.removeEventListener('message', onMessageReceived)
  })

  const classify = useCallback((text) => {
    if (worker.current) {
      worker.current.postMessage({ text })
    }
  }, [])

  // [...]
}
```

## Perform the search

The search is performed in the `complete` case above, where we provide the generated embedding and then perform the inner product search.

And that's it. You've learned about all the components necessary to build a fully local, in-browser semantic search experience. And the best thing is, it's free to use!
