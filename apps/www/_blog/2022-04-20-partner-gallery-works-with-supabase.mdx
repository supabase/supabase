# Introducing our Partner Gallery - open source and made with Supabase

Supabase is a collaborative effort across many open-source projects, and we’re incredibly fortunate that you all have rallied around us to make Supabase what it is today.

To keep track of all the great tools and people that “Work With Supabase”, we’ve built a [Partner Gallery](/partners) that showcases integration partners who are extending how Supabase works, as well as experts who are certified to help you build new, exciting things.

![partner-gallery-screenshot.png](/images/blog/partner-gallery/partner-gallery-screenshot.png)

As with anything at Supabase, the Partner Gallery is built on top of the [Supabase stack](/docs/guides/getting-started/architecture) and is, of course, open-source. If you’re looking to build a partner gallery yourself, feel free to use our template as a start: [github.com/supabase-community/partner-gallery-example](https://github.com/supabase-community/partner-gallery-example). It’s packed with goodies like [Postgres Full Text Search](/docs/guides/database/full-text-search), `next-image` with Supabase Storage, and sending emails based on an insert trigger with Supabase Edge Functions.
