This month the Beta Update is a Launch Week special. #SupaLaunchWeek 5 just happened and it was a big one, so we revisit everything we shipped, congratulate the winners of the Supa Hackathon, and of course we have the extended the Community Highlights.

## Day 1 - Supabase CLI v1 and Management API Beta

![Day 1 - Supabase CLI v1 and Management API Beta](/images/blog/2022-august/CLI.png)

The Supabase CLI is now in v1.0 (including the ability to generate TypeScript types üéâ). We also released the Management API Beta, a REST API that opens the door to a whole new suite of integrations (Zapier, Terraform, Pulumi, you name it). Full programmatic control of your projects and orgs is on the way.

## Platform Updates

The following changes to the Supabase Platform will take effect from September 11th at 7 pm PDT.

-   HTTP API requests to Supabase will automatically be redirected to HTTPS.
-   The API Key was passed to Supabase both in the `Authorization` header and in a separate `apiKey` header. This led to confusion among new users of Supabase who used the API directly. It is no longer required to send the anon key or service key via the `apiKey` header. If you are using Supabase via our client libraries, no change is required from your side.
