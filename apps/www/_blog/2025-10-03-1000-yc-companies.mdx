Today we’re excited to share that more than **1,000 Y Combinator companies have chosen Supabase** to build and scale their products. These companies include some of the most innovative startups in the world today, including [Resend](https://supabase.com/customers/resend), [Quivr](https://supabase.com/customers/quivr), and [Markprompt](https://supabase.com/customers/markprompt). **In the most recent Y Combinator batch, 55% of companies chose to build on Supabase**.

Y Combinator (YC) is the world’s most influential startup accelerator, known for backing companies like Airbnb, Stripe, and Dropbox at their earliest stages (including Supabase!). Its model of intensive mentorship, a powerful alumni network, and direct access to top investors has made it the gold standard for launching high-growth technology startups.

Likewise, Supabase was built to help the fastest and most ambitious builders. We are proud to be the platform of choice for YC companies.

## A platform for builders

The most important part of finding product market fit is getting products in the hands of your customers as fast as possible and iterating on their feedback until you find something that works. Supabase is a fully functional back end out of the box, with all the power of Postgres under the hood. Developers and non-developers alike can start in minutes, using an integrated suite of tools, and scaling without retooling or vendor lock-in.
