Today we’re excited to share that more than **1,000 Y Combinator companies have chosen Supabase** to build and scale their products. These companies include some of the most innovative startups in the world today, including [Resend](https://supabase.com/customers/resend), [Quivr](https://supabase.com/customers/quivr), and [Markprompt](https://supabase.com/customers/markprompt). **In the most recent Y Combinator batch, 55% of companies chose to build on Supabase**.

Y Combinator (YC) is the world’s most influential startup accelerator, known for backing companies like Airbnb, Stripe, and Dropbox at their earliest stages (including Supabase!). Its model of intensive mentorship, a powerful alumni network, and direct access to top investors has made it the gold standard for launching high-growth technology startups.

Likewise, Supabase was built to help the fastest and most ambitious builders. We are proud to be the platform of choice for YC companies.

  We were up and running with Supabase in no time. The combination of easy setup and
  production-ready auth gave us the confidence to focus on our product instead of infrastructure.
  For a startup, that speed makes all the difference.

  Supabase has been game-changing for us. It was the obvious choice to start out, and it has scaled
  with us. Every time I start thinking it might be time to switch off, they launch a new feature or
  I find an extension that is exactly what I need. It has literally saved me weeks of time.

  We've been building on Supabase since day 1 and absolutely love it. We'd die before we switch off
  Supabase.

## A platform for builders

The most important part of finding product market fit is getting products in the hands of your customers as fast as possible and iterating on their feedback until you find something that works. Supabase is a fully functional back end out of the box, with all the power of Postgres under the hood. Developers and non-developers alike can start in minutes, using an integrated suite of tools, and scaling without retooling or vendor lock-in.

- [Database](https://supabase.com/database), [Auth](https://supabase.com/auth), [Storage](https://supabase.com/storage), [Edge Functions](https://supabase.com/edge-functions), [Realtime](https://supabase.com/realtime), and [Vector](https://supabase.com/modules/vector) search.
- Seamless integration with popular frameworks.
- Predictable pricing that scales with usage.
- World-class support.

Startups that choose Supabase can build and scale their product without the backend bottleneck.

## Builders are everywhere

Of course, you don’t need to be backed by Y Combinator to build a successful startup. Fast-growing companies like [Udio](https://supabase.com/customers/udio), [Euka](https://supabase.com/customers/euka), and [Pebblely](https://supabase.com/customers/pebblely) are also built on Supabase. Supabase is proud to partner with more than 80 other startup accelerators and early-stage investors across the global startup ecosystem, a program that we are rapidly expanding. Why? Because we believe in the power of builders to change the world - and we want to help you build faster!
