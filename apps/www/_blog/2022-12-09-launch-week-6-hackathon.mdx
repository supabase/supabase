### Additional Info

- Any intellectual property developed during the hackathon will belong to the team that developed it. We expect that each team will have an agreement between themselves regarding the IP, but this is not required
- By making a submission you grant Supabase permission to use screenshots, code-snippets and/or links to your project or content of your README on our Twitter, blog, website, email updates, and in the Supabase discord server. Supabase does not make any claims over your IP.
- $1500 prize will be paid by making a GitHub sponsorship to the winning repo, $500/month for 3 months. The goal here is to create a sustainable project that will be continue to be maintained for the duration of the sponsorship period (and hopefully beyond :) )
