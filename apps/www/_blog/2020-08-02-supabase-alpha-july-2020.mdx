After 5 months of building, we're releasing one of our most anticipated features: Supabase Auth.

### Auth

This month, we're ecstatic to announce a feature we think you'll love: Supabase Auth. It's too big to fit into a monthly update so look out for a full update in the next few days.

We want to make it easy to get started adding Auth to your app, so we've released a [simple example and a video tutorial](https://dev.to/supabase/create-a-slack-clone-with-next-js-and-supabase-3lhd) which shows you how to implement a basic auth system using PostgreSQL's Row Level Security.

### Table Editor

We've made some massive improvements to our Table Editor that we're excited to share.

#### Relationship drill down

Last month we made it easy to drill into your table relationships. This month, we make it possible to drill multiple levels deep.

#### Add, delete, and download rows

We're making it easier to manipulate your data. Next month, you'll be able to add and remove columns directly from the Table view.

### New Postgres Extensions

If you launch a new Supabase project, you'll have access to several new Postgres extensions:

- [pgsql-http](https://github.com/pramsey/pgsql-http): HTTP client for PostgreSQL, retrieve a web page from inside the database.
- [pgjwt](https://github.com/michelp/pgjwt): PostgreSQL implementation of JSON Web Tokens
- [plpgsql_check](https://github.com/okbob/plpgsql_check): a linter tool for language PL/pgSQL
- [pljava](https://github.com/tada/pljava): write Java in your stored procedures, triggers, and functions

### Kaizen

We have a number of small improvements:

- Added Auth documentation to the auto-generated docs in each project
- Added a new `or` filter [to the client library](/docs/library/get#or)
- Table View now remembers which tabs you had open.
- We have [released](https://github.com/supabase/postgres-meta/releases) a lot of new functionality to [postgres-meta](https://github.com/supabase/postgres-meta), a server for for managing Postgres internals via a REST interface.
- Performance: the "flash of black" which was appearing on page transition is now gone
