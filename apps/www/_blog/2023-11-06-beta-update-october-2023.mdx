Last month we merged over 800 PRs from more than 100 contributors. If you want to play a part in building Supabase, check out our [core](https://github.com/supabase) and [community](https://github.com/supabase-community/) repos. More hands are always welcome, and no matter your framework of choice there are always interesting problems to work on.

Here are some of the major items we shipped during October‚Ä¶

## Server-Side Auth in Next.js 14

![Server-Side Auth in Next.js 14](https://obuldanrptloktxcffvn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/marketing-emails/october2023/1.png)

We've released `@supabase/ssr`, which makes it super easy to use cookies for storing user sessions. We‚Äôve updated `npx create-next-app -e with-supabase` to use `@supabase/ssr` and made it compatible with Next.js 14.

[Read the blog post](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-is-now-compatible-with-nextjs-14).

## pgvector vs Pinecone

![pgvector vs Pinecone](https://obuldanrptloktxcffvn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/marketing-emails/october2023/2.png)

pgvector is becoming the vector store of choice for developers. We‚Äôve put it to the test against Pinecone and found that it performs better on cost and query throughput, without sacrificing accuracy.

[See the full benchmarks](https://supabase.com/blog/pgvector-vs-pinecone)

## Manage storage buckets from the command line

![Manage storage buckets from the command line](https://obuldanrptloktxcffvn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/images/marketing-emails/october2023/storage-buckets-cli.png)

You can now manage Storage buckets with the Supabase CLI:

- `supabase storage ls -r`: show all buckets and objects
- `supabase cp -r readme.md ss:///bucket`: upload local files to bucket
- `supabase cp -r ss:///bucket`: download objects from bucket
- `supabase rm -r ss:///bucket`: delete files from bucket

Managing Storage buckets with CLI works best if there are less than 100k objects in your bucket and each of them is smaller than 20MB. Reference docs are [here](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/cli/supabase-storage-ls).

## What's new in Supabase Studio?
