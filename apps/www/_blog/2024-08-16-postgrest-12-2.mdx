[PostgREST 12.2](https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/releases/tag/v12.2.0) is out! It comes with Observability and API improvements. In this post, we'll see what's new.

## Prometheus Metrics

Version 12.2 ships with Prometheus-compatible metrics for PostgREST's schema cache and connection pool. These are useful for troubleshooting, for example, when PostgREST's pool is starved for connections.

```bash
curl localhost:3001/metrics

# HELP pgrst_db_pool_timeouts_total The total number of pool connection timeouts
# TYPE pgrst_db_pool_timeouts_total counter
pgrst_db_pool_timeouts_total 7.0

# ....
```

A full list of supported metrics is available in the [PostgREST documentation](https://postgrest.org/en/latest/references/observability.html#metrics).

## Hoisted Function Settings

Sometimes it's handy to set a custom timeout per function. You can now do this on 12.2 projects with:

```sql
create or replace function special_function()
returns void as $$
  select pg_sleep(3); -- simulating some long-running process
$$
language sql
set statement_timeout to '4s';
```

And calling the function with the [RPC interface](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/rpc).

When doing `set statement_timeout`on the function, the `statement_timeout` will be “hoisted” and applied per transaction.

By default this also works for other settings, namely `plan_filter.statement_cost_limit` and `default_transaction_isolation`. The list of hoisted settings can be extended by modifying the [db-hoisted-tx-settings](https://postgrest.org/en/latest/references/configuration.html#db-hoisted-tx-settings) configuration.

Before 12.2, this could be done by setting a `statement_timeout` on the API roles, but this affected all the SQL statements executed by those roles.

## Max Affected

In prior versions of PostgREST, users could limit the number of records impacted by mutations (insert/update/delete) to 1 row using vendor media type `application/vnd.pgrst.object+json`. That supports a common use case but is not flexible enough to support user defined values.

12.2 introduces the `max-affected` preference to limit the affected rows up to a custom value.

For example:

```bash
curl -i "http://localhost:3000/items?id=lt.15" -X DELETE \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Prefer: handling=strict, max-affected=10"
```

If the number of affected records exceeds `max-affected` , an error is returned:

```bash
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
{
    "code": "PGRST124",
    "message": "Query result exceeds max-affected preference constraint",
    "details": "The query affects 14 rows",
    "hint": null
}
```

## **Try it out**

PostgREST v12.2 is already available on the Supabase platform on its latest patch version ([v12.2.3](https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/releases/tag/v12.2.3)) for new projects. Spin up a new project or upgrade your existing project to try it out!
