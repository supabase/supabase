**UPDATE 15/08/2022:** [Supabase CLI V1 is Generally Available](/blog/supabase-cli-v1-and-admin-api-beta) and we also released a Management API (in beta).

Today is Day 3 of [Launch Week](/blog/launch-week), and as promised - we're releasing our CLI.

This is the first step in a long journey of features we plan to deliver:

- Running Supabase locally
- Managing database migrations
- Generating types directly from your database schema
- Generating API and validation schemas from your database
- Managing your Supabase projects
- Pushing your local changes to production

Here are some of the items we have completed so far.

## Running Supabase Locally

You can now run Supabase on your local machine, using Docker Compose. This Docker setup is 100% compatible with every project on Supabase - the tools used for local development are exactly the same as production.

We have released a full set of documentation [here](/docs/guides/local-development). In this post we thought it would be useful to highlight how easy it is to get started.

A lot of Supabase developers are familiar with React, so here are the steps you would use to create a new React project which uses Supabase as a backend.

Install the CLI:

```bash
npm install -g supabase
```

Set up your React app:

```bash
# create a fresh React app
npx create-react-app react-demo --use-npm

# move into the new folder
cd react-demo

# Save the install supabase-js library
npm install --save @supabase/supabase-js
```

Set up Supabase:

```bash
supabase init

# ✔ Port for Supabase URL: · 8000
# ✔ Port for PostgreSQL database: · 5432
# ✔ Project initialized.
# Supabase URL: http://localhost:8000
# Supabase Key (anon, public): eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsImlhdCI6MTYwMzk2ODgzNCwiZXhwIjoyNTUwNjUzNjM0LCJyb2xlIjoiYW5vbiJ9.36fUebxgx1mcBo4s19v0SzqmzunP--hm_hep0uLX0ew
# Supabase Key (service_role, private): eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsImlhdCI6MTYwMzk2ODgzNCwiZXhwIjoyNTUwNjUzNjM0LCJyb2xlIjoiYW5vbiJ9.36fUebxgx1mcBo4s19v0SzqmzunP--hm_hep0uLX0ew
# Database URL: postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres
```

Now that your application is now prepared, you can use Supabase anywhere in your application (for example, `App.js`):

```jsx
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'
const SUPABASE_URL = 'http://localhost:8000'
const SUPABASE_ANON_KEY =
  'eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsImlhdCI6MTYwMzk2ODgzNCwiZXhwIjoyNTUwNjUzNjM0LCJyb2xlIjoiYW5vbiJ9.36fUebxgx1mcBo4s19v0SzqmzunP--hm_hep0uLX0ew'
const supabase = createClient(SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY)
```

Then start the backend and the frontend:

```bash
supabase start  # Start Supabase
npm start       # Start the React app
```

If everything is working you should have a React app running on `http://localhost:3000` and Supabase services running on `http://localhost:8000`!

### Next steps:

Soon we will give you the ability to push your changes from your local machine to your Production project. How will we do that? Migrations!

## Migrations

Database Migrations are a process to "change" your database schema. In a NoSQL database you don't need migrations, because you can insert any JSON data without validation. However with Relational databases you define your schema upfront, and the database will reject data which doesn't "fit" the schema. This is one of the reasons Relational databases are so scalable - schemas ensure data integrity.

Just like an application though, a database schema needs to be constantly updated. And that's where migrations fit! Migrations are simply a set of SQL scripts which change your database schema.

There is one problem however: there is [no "right" way](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21405501) to do migrations.

### Diffs

At Supabase, we do have one strong preference. We like schema "diffing" over "manual migrations".

Manual migrations work like this:

- A developer thinks about all the changes they want to make to their database
- They create a SQL script which will cause those changes
- They run that script on their database

After a while though, these scripts pile up - the `migrations` folder can contain hundreds of migration scripts. This method is also "version control" on top of another version control system (i.e. git).

A "diff" tool works like this:

- a developer makes all the changes they desire to a local database
- they use a tool to compare their local database to the production database
- the tool then generates all the SQL scripts that are required, and runs them on the target database

In this case, the tool does all the hard work. This is obviously an ideal state. Databases schemas are declarative, and when you check them into git, you can see their evolution over time. The hard part is finding a tool which can handle all the edge-cases of database diff'ing.

### Choosing the best diff tool

After evaluating these OSS tools:

- [migra](https://github.com/djrobstep/migra) (Python)
- [dbdiff](https://github.com/gimenete/dbdiff) (JS)
- [pgdiff](https://github.com/joncrlsn/pgdiff) (Go)
- [apgdiff](https://github.com/fordfrog/apgdiff) (Java)
- [pgquarrel](https://github.com/eulerto/pgquarrel) (C)
- [pgAdmin Schema Diff](https://www.pgadmin.org/docs/pgadmin4/development/schema_diff.html) (Python)

We found that the most complete one was the pgAdmin Schema Diff, migra came a close second.

The deciding factor was if the tool could track an owner change for a VIEW.

```sql
ALTER VIEW my_view OWNER TO authenticated;
```

This is critical for Row Level Security to work with views. For policies to kick in on views, the owner must not have `superuser` or `bypassrls` privileges. Currently migra doesn't track this change ([issue](https://github.com/djrobstep/migra/issues/160)), while the pgAdmin Schema Diff does.

There was a problem in using the [pgAdmin Schema Diff](https://www.pgadmin.org/docs/pgadmin4/development/schema_diff.html) though, it's a GUI-only tool.

![pgadmin diff](/images/blog/cli/pgadmin-diff.png)

So we did what we always strive to do - improve existing open source software. We created a CLI mode for the Schema Diff on [our repo](https://github.com/supabase/pgadmin4/blob/cli/web/cli.py). We've also released a [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/supabase/pgadmin-schema-diff) for a quick start.

The CLI offers the same functionality as the GUI version. You can diff two databases by specifying the connection strings like shown below.

```bash
docker run supabase/pgadmin-schema-diff \
  'postgres://user:pass@local:5432/diff_source' \
  'postgres://user:pass@production:5432/diff_target' \
  > diff_demo.sql

Done.

## the diff is written to diff_demo.sql
```

A sample diff can be seen on this [gist](https://gist.github.com/steve-chavez/3f286a233806aeee0bcea4a47f97f0b5). This was generated by diffing these [two databases](https://github.com/supabase/pgadmin4/tree/cli/web/pgadmin/tools/schema_diff/tests/pg/10_plus).

On these [lines](https://gist.github.com/steve-chavez/3f286a233806aeee0bcea4a47f97f0b5#file-diff_demo-sql-L1022-L1023), you can see how it tracks the view's owner change (note: the `ALTER TABLE` statement is interchangeable with `ALTER VIEW` in this case). Additionally, you can see that it handles [domains](https://gist.github.com/steve-chavez/3f286a233806aeee0bcea4a47f97f0b5#file-diff_demo-sql-L278-L287) just fine, this is an edge-case that other diff tools don't handle.

Also, similarly to the pgAdmin GUI:

- You can include and exclude database objects from the diff with `--include-objects` or `--exclude-objects`
- You can choose a single schema to diff with the `--schema` argument or you can pick different schemas to compare with the --source-schema and --target-schema arguments. We recommend you do this for Supabase databases. Diffing the whole database can take a while because of the `extensions` schema (especially if you enable PostGIS, which adds many functions).

### Next steps

Once we have added logins to the CLI, we will be able to use Migrations to create a seamless workflow between local development and your production database.

Also, the pgAdmin team has showed [interest](https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/CA%2BOCxoyjZhV9stFMAQ-QhHuA0%2BdLQD5XD_YT%2BQo2vY0GhkBKFw%40mail.gmail.com) in including our Schema Diff CLI in the official pgAdmin. We'll be working with them to include this change upstream to benefit the whole community.

## Self Hosting

Finally, we are adding one critical command to our CLI for everybody who wants to self-host:

```bash
supabase eject
```

This gives you everything you need to run the Supabase stack.

After running the command inside the terminal, you will see three items:

- `docker-compose.yml` (file)
- `kong` (directory)
- `postgres` (directory)

If you have an existing Postgres database running elsewhere you can easily drop the Postgres directory but first make sure you do these three things:

- run the .sql files from the Postgres directory on your existing database
- update all references to the DB URI in `docker-compose.yml` to your existing database
- run [these steps](https://github.com/supabase/realtime#server) to enable replication inside the database, so that the realtime engine can stream changes from your database

You may also want to play with the environment variables for each application inside `docker-compose.yml`. [PostgREST](https://postgrest.org/en/v7.0.0/configuration.html) has many additional configuration options, as does [GoTrue](https://github.com/supabase/gotrue#configuration). In the hosted version of Supabase we connect our own SMTP service to GoTrue for sending auth emails, so you may also want to add these settings here in order to enable this.

Also check `kong.yml` inside the `kong` directory where you'll see how all the services are routed to, and with what rules, down the bottom you'll find the JWTs capable of accessing services that require API Key access.

Once you're all set, you can start the stack by running:

```bash
docker compose up
```

Head over to the [Self Hosting Docs](/docs/guides/self-hosting) for a more complete walk through, it also includes several [one-click deploys](/docs/guides/self-hosting#one-click-deploys), so you can easily deploy into your own cloud hosting provider.
