We're excited to welcome Matt Linkous, co-founder of [Triplit](https://www.triplit.dev/), to the Supabase team.

With this acquisition, we're bringing Matt's deep expertise in the offline-first domain into our ecosystem. Our focus isn't to directly integrate Triplit into our platform. Instead, Matt will be working to expand third-party integrations at Supabase. Part of this effort will be making Supabase an excellent partner to other syncing systems such as [ElectricSQL](https://electric-sql.com/), [Zero](https://zero.rocicorp.dev/), and [PowerSync](https://www.powersync.com/).
Creating a great self-serve integration system is a growing priority at Supabase, so we're excited for Matt to bring his experience as Y Combinator founder and open-source maintainer to build an integration experience that's seamless for both developers using Supabase and third-party providers.

### Offline mode when?

We know, firsthand, that there is a lot of demand for better offline mode experience. However, solving offline mode in a way that works for everyone is a formidable challenge. And while Triplit exemplifies how rethinking the database from the ground up can create an admirable developer experience, this move is about Matt's expertise and collaboration, not about immediately using Triplit to solve offline needs at Supabase. We'll continue to explore the best paths forward for offline functionality and communicate transparently as those plans evolve.

### What Happens With Triplit's Code

Triplit is already largely open-source but as part of his onboarding, Matt will spend time further open-sourcing the Triplit codebase, documenting the patterns they used, and sharing lessons learned. We hope this knowledge sharing will help support the offline-first community and spark new ideas in the ecosystem.

### Next Steps

Stay tuned as we integrate Matt into our team and leverage his insights to enhance the Supabase developer experience. We're excited for what's to come and grateful for your support as we continue to grow.
