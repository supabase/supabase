### Improve your docs inline

Add comments and descriptions to your Tables directly from our auto-generated docs. Descriptions are stored as PostgreSQL comments (https://postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-comment.html), and are exposed over your OpenAPI spec.

### Supabase raised a Seed Round

We raised $6M from Y Combinator, Mozilla, and Coatue. You can read more on [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/supabase-raises-6m-for-its-open-source-firebase-alternative).

### Kaizen

- Supabase is now 26% faster in regions which support Graviton (1460 reqs/s up from 1167 reqs/s)
- We launched a new region in Sao Paulo.
- Postgres Array Support. You can now edit Native Postgres array items in the grid editor or the side panel.
- We added better support for your custom Database Types.
- Fixed some buggy keyboard commands. We're continuously improving key commands in the Table editor.
