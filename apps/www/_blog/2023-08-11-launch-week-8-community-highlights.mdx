WIP intro

## Ecosystem partners

We‚Äôve seen a lot of new partners and big updates in the ecosystem since our last Launch Week. Here are a few of the highlights.

### Integrations Marketplace

We‚Äôve been running our Integrations Marketplace in ‚Äústealth mode‚Äù for about a year now and has now grown to [over 60 integrations](https://supabase.com/partners/integrations). In the last couple of months, we‚Äôve added amazing products like [N8N](https://supabase.com/partners/integrations/n8n), [Passage by 1 Password](https://supabase.com/partners/integrations/passageidentity), and [Refine](https://supabase.com/partners/integrations/refine_dev). This Launch Week we‚Äôve made it easy to [build an integration](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/oauth-apps/build-a-supabase-integration#create-an-oauth-app) using OAuth2 and the Management API in the new [Supabase Integrations Marketplace](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-integrations-marketplace). We've started with a few partners to help us build and test the OAuth functionality, including [Cloudflare](https://supabase.com/partners/integrations/cloudflare-workers), [Resend](https://supabase.com/partners/integrations/resend), [Snaplet](https://supabase.com/partners/integrations/snaplet), [Trigger.dev](https://supabase.com/partners/integrations/triggerdotdev), [Windmill](https://supabase.com/partners/integrations/vercel), and [Vercel](https://supabase.com/partners/integrations/windmill).

### pgvector

[pgvector](github.com/pgvector/pgvector/) adds vector capabilities to Postgres. We continue to work with the pgvector creator, [Andrew Kane](https://twitter.com/andrewkane), and others contributing to the project. In the past few months, we‚Äôve added robust benchmarks to show how to [scale your ivfflat workloads](https://supabase.com/blog/pgvector-performance) and established guidance on the [best models](https://supabase.com/blog/fewer-dimensions-are-better-pgvector) to use with pgvectors. With v0.5.0 coming soon, we‚Äôre extremely excited about the improved HNSW index. Performance and recall improvement are looking [significantly better](https://jkatz05.com/post/postgres/pgvector-hnsw-performance/) than the current ivfflat index in pgvector.

### PostgREST

Last month we rolled out support across the platform [PostgREST 11.1](https://supabase.com/blog/postgrest-11-1-release). A huge shoutout to [Steve Chavez](https://twitter.com/_steve_chavez) for his continued support as the primary maintainer of the project. [PostgREST 11.2](https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/releases/tag/v11.2.0) was released yesterday, adding [Domain Representations](https://postgrest.org/en/v11.2/references/api/domain_representations.html), and we‚Äôll roll it out to platform soon.

### LlamaIndex

In one of the most community-driven contributions ever, a tweet from [us](https://twitter.com/kiwicopple/status/1664377669935349760?s=20), and a tweet from [LlamaIndex](https://twitter.com/jerryjliu0/status/1664413942045904896), led to a contribution from [a16z](https://twitter.com/stuffyokodraws/status/1664532449815302145?s=20). And a few days later we had a [Supabase Vector Store implementation in LlamaIndex](https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/vector_stores/SupabaseVectorIndexDemo.html).

### Transloadit

The team at Transloadit are committed to building an open protocol for resumable uploads, to make it the standard for file uploads on the internet. We used two of their [tus-node-server](https://github.com/tus/tus-node-server/) for our recent [updates to Storage](https://supabase.com/blog/storage-v3-resumable-uploads), and contributed back a few important changes as a result. **[Check out their post about our collaboration](https://transloadit.com/blog/2023/08/casestudy-supabase/)**

### Mozilla

We are huge fans of Mozilla at Supabase, so it was an honor when chose [Supabase Vector](https://supabase.com/vector) to build AI Help, a ChatGPT-like interface to the most popular developer docs on the internet: **[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)**. [Learn more in their official announcement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/blog/introducing-ai-help/).

## New Kotlin Library

![IMAGE GOES HERE]()

Are you a mobile dev? We now have client libraries for Android. This is thanks to one of our community members - [@TheRealJanGER](https://twitter.com/TheRealJanGER). Try it out, and if you want to help us maintain the library let us know.

[Quickstart](https://supabase.com/blog/native-mobile-auth)¬†|¬†[Tutorial](https://supabase.com/blog/native-mobile-auth)

## Framework support

### Next.js Supabase Starter template

We added support for Next.js 13‚Äôs App router, including Cookie-based Auth; Nicely styled authentication form with Tailwind CSS; Examples for Client Components, Server Components, Route Handlers, and Server Actions; and - of course - 100% TypeScript. Get started with one simple command:

```bash
npx create-next-app -e with-supabase
```

### Nuxt Supabase module

The team at Nuxt [added support](https://twitter.com/_larbish/status/1687044609522778112) for the PKCE Auth Flow in their [Supabase x Nuxt module](https://supabase.nuxtjs.org/), making it even more secure. This module is a simple wrapper around [supabase-js](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js) to enable usage and integration within Nuxt.

### Tamagui Takeout

The Tamagui team launched [TakeOut](https://tamagui.dev/takeout), a web and mobile starter that takes featuring everything you need to launch - including a nice backend, powered by Supabase.

### PowerSync

The team at PowerSync just dropped [an (extremely attractive) integration](https://docs.powersync.co/integration-guides/supabase-+-powersync) for building offline-first Flutter apps. This uses Postgres‚Äô built-in Publication functionality to track changes, which are then synced to an offline cache.

## State of the community

### Stack Overflow Survey

![Stack Overflow Survey](apps/www/public/images/blog/launch-week-8/day-5-community/stack-overflow-survey.png)

This was the first year that Supabase appeared on the Stack Overflow survey for [Databases](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#most-popular-technologies-database) as the 17th ‚Äúmost used‚Äù. As a bonus, Postgres took the #1 spot for the first time, and we hope we can continue to contribute to that trend.

### Community Meetups

![Community Meetups](/images/blog/launch-week-8/day-5-community/launch-week-8-meetups.png)

Supabase started as a remote company, and almost everything we‚Äôve done so far has been digital. This Launch Week added in-person meetups throughout the world, 100% organized by the community. We had meetups in 5 countries, with hundreds of attendees across the world. It has been a successful experiment, something we‚Äôll keep for next time. Thanks to Fatuma, Isheanesu, Daniel, Philip, and Thor for organizing!

### Modern Full Stack course

Probably the most comprehensive Supabase resource on the internet, the team at Modern Full Stack just released a 7 chapter, 21 lesson [course on Supabase](https://modernfullstack.com/course/mfs401). The course includes:

1. **Supabase Foundations**

## Contributors

We also want to highlight all the humans who have made meaningful contributions to the Supabase ecosystem since our last Launch Week:

- We‚Äôve continued growing our [community maintainers](https://github.com/orgs/supabase-community/teams), with a particular focus on Mobile. We now have docs for [Swift](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/swift/introduction) and [Kotlin](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/kotlin/introduction).
- [kamilogorek](https://github.com/kamilogorek)¬†and¬†[adiologydev](https://github.com/adiologydev) for integrating Schema Visualizer into the Studio. And another shoutout to the legend,¬†[Zernonia](https://twitter.com/zernonia), for providing the inspiration for this great new feature!
- As always, a big shoutout to [Gary](https://github.com/GaryAustin1)¬†and¬†[Olyno](https://github.com/olyno)¬†- official moderators of our¬†[Discord](https://discord.supabase.com/)¬†and overall incredibly helpful people. The community would not be the same without them.

## Celebrating our flourishing Community

The last months have ushered us into remarkable milestones across various platforms: we are now part of the GitHub 50k üåü club ([and getting close to 55k!](https://github.com/supabase/supabase)), meaning Supabase is one of the top 169 most-popular repositories in all of GitHub ü§Ø. We also broke 80k followers on ùïèwitter, XX Discord members, and 14k YouTube subscribers! In parallel, we are exploring and experimenting with new platforms, so make sure to follow us on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/supabasecom/), [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@supabase.com), and [Threads](https://www.threads.net/@supabasecom)! 

To our incredible community, we extend our heartfelt gratitude for your constant support and love.

## Bonus track: Supabase Album

And finally, I promised Sam (CEO of Planetscale) that we‚Äôd [release an album](https://twitter.com/kiwicopple/status/1664118998169014273) before the end of the year, otherwise I‚Äôd give him 1% of my equity.
