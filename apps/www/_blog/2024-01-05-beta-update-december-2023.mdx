Going through all 64 projects was cool, the most submissions we've ever had. Picking a winner was a bit tricky though, the quality was impressive.

In the end, we chose [Supafork](https://github.com/chroxify/supafork) as the winner of the Best Overall project 👏. Created by [Christo](https://twitter.com/0xChroxify), SupaFork is inspired by Vercel's Deploy button and it allows an easier setup for self-hosted apps using Supabase.
