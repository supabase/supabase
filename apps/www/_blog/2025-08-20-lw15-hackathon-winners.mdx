[Launch Week 15](https://supabase.com/launch-week) brought an incredible array of new Supabase features that got developers' creative engines revving. To harness this excitement, we challenged our amazing community with the Launch Week 15 Hackathon - and wow, did they deliver!

The submissions were truly impressive, showcasing exceptional technical skill and creativity. Our team thoroughly enjoyed reviewing each project, making it challenging to select winners from such a strong pool of entries.

Your personal AI sommelier, take a photo or describe what you're going to eat and the AI gives you the best wine in your budget to go with it, or at the restaurant take a photo of the wine list and write down what you're ordering to find out the best wine to go with it.

## Most fun / best easter egg

### Winner

[SupaClicker](https://github.com/Steellgold/supa-clicker) by [Steellgold](https://github.com/Steellgold)

### Runner Up

[LLM Breakout](https://github.com/akshaykripalani/supahack-lw15) by [akshaykripalani](https://github.com/akshaykripalani) and [MananGandhi1810](https://github.com/MananGandhi1810)

LLM Breakout is a browser-based twist on the classic brick-breaker game. A tastefully sloppy homage to breakout - where your bricks are generated by prompts, rather than being pre-set colorful bricks.
