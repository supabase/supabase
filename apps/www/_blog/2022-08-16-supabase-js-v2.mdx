Today we're publishing a release candidate for [supabase-js v2](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js), which focuses on “quality-of-life” improvements for developers.

Try it out by running `npm i @supabase/supabase-js@rc`

Nearly 2 years ago we [released supabase-js v1](https://supabase.com/blog/improved-dx).
Since then it has been used in over [17K repositories](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js/network/dependents?package_id=UGFja2FnZS04MjM3OTUyMDU%3D) and has grown
to [50K weekly downloads](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@supabase/supabase-js). Supabase users give a lot of great feedback and we've
learned some of the largest pain-points as a result.

This release focuses on solving these pain-points. At the same time we want to make the upgrade path for supabase-js as easy as possible,
so we've been strategic about the changes we're making. We plan to follow this model going forward: incremental changes over huge rewrites.

## Major Updates

### Type support

If you followed yesterday's announcement, you will have noticed that we added
[type generators](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/cli/usage#supabase-gen-types-typescript) to the CLI.

```bash
supabase start
supabase gen types typescript --local > DatabaseDefinitions.ts
```

These types can now be used to enrich your development experience:

```tsx
import type { Database } from './DatabaseDefinitions'

const supabase = createClient<Database>(SUPABASE_URL, ANON_KEY)

const { data } = await supabase.from('messages').select().match({ id: 1 })
```

<details>

<summary>ℹ️ Differences from v1</summary>

v1 also supported types, but the types were generated from the API rather than the database, so it
lost a lot of detailed information. The library also required you to specify the definition in
every function call, rather than at the client level.

```
supabase.from<Database['Message']>('messages').select('*')
```

</details>

### New Auth methods

We're removing the `signIn()` method in favor of more explicit function signatures:
`signInWithPassword()`, `signInWithPasswordless()`, and `signInWithOtp()`.

```ts
// v2
const { data } = await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({
  email: 'hello@example',
  password: 'pass',
})

// v1
const { data } = await supabase.auth.signIn({
  email: 'hello@example',
  password: 'pass',
})
```

This helps with type hinting. Previously it was difficult for developers to know what they were missing.
A lot of developers didn't even realize they could use passwordless magic links.

### Data functions return minimal by default

The `insert()`, `update()`, and `upsert()` functions now require you to explicitly append `select()` if you want the data to be returned.

```ts
// v2
const { data } = await supabase.from('messages').insert({ id: 1, message: 'Hello world' }).select() // select is now explicitly required

// v1
const { data } = await supabase.from('messages').insert({ id: 1, message: 'Hello world' }) // insert would also "select()"
```

This was another common question in our GitHub Discussions. While the idea of automatically returning data is great,
developers often turn on Row Level Security (which is great), and then they forget to add a `select` Policy.
It is a bit surprising that you need to add a `select` policy to do an `insert`, so we opted for the “principle of least surprise”.
If you don't append `select()`, the `data` value will be an empty object: `{}`.

<details>

<summary>ℹ️ Differences from v1</summary>

Previously you could pass a `returning: 'minimal'` option to the `insert()`, `update()`, and
`upsert()` statements. We've now made this the default behaviour.

### Multiplayer Sneak Peek

There is a new `channel()` interface which we have released in v2.
This is a "preparatory" release for our upcoming [multiplayer](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-realtime-with-multiplayer-features) features.

```ts
supabaseClient
  .channel('any_string_you_want')
  .on('presence', { event: 'track' }, (payload) => {
    console.log(payload)
  })
  .subscribe()
```

As part of this change, the old `from().on().subscribe()` method for listening to database changes will be changing:

```ts
// v2
supabaseClient
  .channel('any_string_you_want')
  .on(
    'postgres_changes',
    {
      event: 'INSERT',
      schema: 'public',
      table: 'movies',
    },
    (payload) => {
      console.log(payload)
    }
  )
  .subscribe()

// v1
supabase
  .from('movies')
  .on('INSERT', (payload) => {
    console.log(payload)
  })
  .subscribe()
```

You can listen to PostgreSQL database changes on any channel you want by subscribing to the `'postgres_changes'` event.
For now, we will continue to support `from().on().subscribe()`, but in the future we will deprecate this in favor of the `channel().on().subscribe()` method.

### Async Auth overhaul

We've rebuilt the Auth library, making it async for almost all functions.

```ts
// v2
const { data } = await supabase.auth.getSession()

// v1
const { data } = supabase.auth.session()
```

This solves the “getting logged out” issue, which has been a recurring issue in our GitHub Discussions.
