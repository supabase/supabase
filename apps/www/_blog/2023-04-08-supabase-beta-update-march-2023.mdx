Launch Week is about to start and, as usual, we're running an async hackathon alongside it. This time it is Web3 AI-themed. It officially starts now and ends Monday 16th April at 11:59 pm. You can win Supabase keyboards and limited edition Supabase swag!

## Unveiling the creation process of our ticket system

The ticket system has become an essential component of the Launch Week experience. To make each experience unique, we strive to add a twist. This time, we came up with an AI-fueled design and an infinite scroll of tickets to showcase the community. We documented everything in two blog posts:

- [Infinite scroll with Next.js, Framer Motion, and Supabase](https://supabase.com/blog/infinite-scroll-with-nextjs-framer-motion)
- [Designing with AI: Generating unique artwork for every user](https://supabase.com/blog/designing-with-ai-midjourney)

## SupaClub

On April 1st, we announced a new product: SupaClub (pronounced “Super-Clurb”), the world’s first Software Engineering Nightclub. Fyre Fest investor Ja Rule and “Super Bass” songstress Niki Minaj will perform on the opening night, which is now sold out.
