The ticket system has become an essential component of the Launch Week experience. To make each experience unique, we strive to add a twist. This time, we came up with an AI-fueled design and an infinite scroll of tickets to showcase the community. We documented everything in two blog posts:

- [Infinite scroll with Next.js, Framer Motion, and Supabase](https://supabase.com/blog/infinite-scroll-with-nextjs-framer-motion)
- [Designing with AI: Generating unique artwork for every user](https://supabase.com/blog/designing-with-ai-midjourney)

## SupaClub
