For a developer tool, documentation is more than a resource - it’s part of the product. For the past two years at Supabase, this part of our product hasn’t been great. Today’s release fixes that.

## A brief history of documentation at Supabase

When Supabase started in 2020, our website and our docs were powered by (the excellent) [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), which allowed us to move quickly and efficiently.

However, as time went on, we began to face some challenges:

- We added versioning to our client libraries. With multiple client libraries, each with different versions, this increased the complexity and reduced the maintainability. Contributors and team members had a hard time figuring out how to contribute fixes and new docs.
- It introduced friction with the rest of our stack (Next.js & Turborepo). We have a monorepo of various Next.js sites and a Supabase [UI library](https://ui.supabase.com/) which is used across all of them. The docs site was the only site that wasn’t Next.js.

In short: we outgrew Docusaurus.
