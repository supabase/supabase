On November 22 + 23 we’re hosting an AI-focused hackathon at Y Combinator in San Francisco.

We’ve already seen [several 1M+ user AI applications](https://x.com/kiwicopple/status/1754777201092784209) built on Supabase and are hosting this event to support the next wave.

YC’s generously offered to host the event and will be there to judge projects alongside Copple and Ant.

Because we have limited capacity, we’ve created [a very short application](https://forms.supabase.com/yai-hackathon). We’ll keep the form open for a few weeks and let you know if you’re in by early November.

We encourage everyone to apply and hope to see you there!
