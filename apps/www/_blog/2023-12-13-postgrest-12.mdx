PostgREST 12 is out. In this post, we'll focus on a few of the major features. For the complete list, check out the [release on GitHub](https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/releases/tag/v12.0.0).

## Performance: JWT Caching

Until now, PostgREST has validated JWTs on every request. As of PostgREST 12, the JWT is cached on the first request using the `exp` claim to set the cache entry's lifetime.

Why is that a big deal? Well, it turns out decoding JWTs is expensive. Very expensive.

```
## before
$ curl 'localhost:3000/authors_only' -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT" -D -
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server-Timing: jwt;dur=147.7

## after, with JWT caching
$ curl 'localhost:3000/authors_only' -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT" -D -
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server-Timing: jwt;dur=14.1
```

The JWT cache shaves over 130ms off the server side timing. For projects with a high volume of API calls, upgrading to PostgREST 12 gives you faster responses, higher throughput, and lower resource consumption.

## Server Timing Header

Did you notice the `Server-Timing` header in the last example? [That's new too](https://postgrest.org/en/v12.0/references/admin.html#server-timing-header) and it does more than measure JWT decoding duration.

Here's a complete reference to what you can extract from your responses:

```
Server-Timing:
	jwt;dur=14.9,
	parse;dur=71.1,
	plan;dur=109.0,
	transaction;dur=353.2,
	response;dur=4.4
```

Where the information from each phase is internally timed by PostgREST for better visibility into server side performance.

## Aggregate Functions

Support for aggregate functions has been [much requested feature](https://github.com/supabase/postgrest-js/issues/206) that went through multiple iterations of design and review.

Currently, PostgREST supports `avg`, `count`, `max`, `min`, `sum`. Here's a minimal example using `count`:

```
$ curl 'http://postgrest/blog_post?select=id.count()'

[
  {
    "count": 51,
  }
]
```

We can also add a “group by” simply by adding another element to the select clause.

```
$ curl 'http://postgrest/blog_post?select=title,id.count()'

[
  {
    "title": "Supabase Blog",
    "count": 40
  },
  {
    "title": "Contributors Blog",
    "count": 11
  },
  ...
```

This example only scratches the surface. Aggregates are fully-compatible with [resource embedding](https://postgrest.org/en/stable/references/api/resource_embedding.html) which yields an extremely versatile interface. We'll explore this feature more in a deep-dive coming soon.

## Media Type Handlers

PostgREST now gives you the flexibility to [handle your custom media types and override the built-in ones](https://postgrest.org/en/v12.0/references/api/media_type_handlers.html). Among other things, that enables [serving HTML, javascript, or whatever you can think of, straight from your database](https://postgrest.org/en/latest/how-tos/providing-html-content-using-htmx.html).

```sql
create domain "text/html" as text;

create or replace function api.index()
returns "text/html"
language sql
as $$
  select $html$
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
      <meta charset="utf-8">
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
      <title>PostgREST + HTMX To-Do List</title>
      <!-- Tailwind for CSS styling -->
      <link href="https://unpkg.com/tailwindcss@2.2.19/dist/tailwind.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
    </head>
    <body class="bg-gray-900">
      <div class="flex justify-center">
        <div class="max-w-lg mt-5 p-6 bg-gray-800 border border-gray-800 rounded-lg shadow-xl">
          <h5 class="mb-3 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-white">PostgREST + HTMX To-Do List</h5>
        </div>
      </div>
    </body>
    </html>
  $html$;
$$;
```

With PostgREST running locally we can then navigate to [localhost:3000/rpc/index](http://localhost:3000/rpc/index) to see

We're still working through the full implications of this feature, but we're very excited internally about the possibilities it unlocks! Similar to aggregate functions, there's a dedicated post for this feature on the way.

## Availability

For self-hosting, check out the PostgREST [release on GitHub](https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/releases/tag/v12.0.0).

The latest version will be rolled out across all projects on the managed platform soon. Keep an eye out for notifications inside [Supabase Studio](https://supabase.com/dashboard).
