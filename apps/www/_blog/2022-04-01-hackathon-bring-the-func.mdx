We can’t believe that it’s already a wrap on our [fourth launch week](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-launch-week-four)! To keep the party and excitement going, and as [is now tradition](https://supabase.com/blog/community-day#launch-week-iv---what-to-expect), starting at 9am PT today we'll be hacking together for the next 10 days until 23:59pm PT on Sunday April 10th. And because we’ve launched [GraphQL support](https://supabase.com/blog/graphql-now-available) and [Supabase Edge Functions](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-enterprise), these will be the major themes and therefore categories for the hackathon.

For some inspiration, check out [TheGuildDev](https://twitter.com/TheGuildDev)’s [GraphQL HackerNews clone](https://supabase-graphql-example.vercel.app/), and [Tyler’s](https://twitter.com/dshukertjr) [Flutter](https://github.com/supabase-community/flutter-stripe-payments-with-supabase-functions) and [Thor’s](https://twitter.com/thorwebdev) [React Native](https://github.com/supabase-community/expo-stripe-payments-with-supabase-functions) apps with Supabase Edge Functions, or have a browse through [madewithsupabase.com](http://madewithsupabase.com)!

As always, we'll have some extremely limited edition swag to give away that can only be won by participating in the Hackathon!

We’re absolutely stoked to see what amazing things y’all will build and submit to [madewithsupabase.com](https://www.madewithsupabase.com/bring-the-func).

Finally, we're delighted to be partnering with [the Future Forest Company](https://thefutureforestcompany.com/) to plant a tree for every project that is being submitted for the Hackathon. Let’s build some cool open-source projects and start the SupaForest at the same time!
