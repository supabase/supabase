With today's launch of Bolt Cloud, every project in [Bolt Cloud](https://bolt.new) that needs a backend is powered by Supabase. Now, when you tell Bolt what you want to build, your project launches with a complete Supabase foundation including:

- A full Postgres Database
- Authentication and user management
- Storage for files, videos, and more
- Edge Functions
- Realtime for more immersive user experiences

Together, Bolt and Supabase give developers and product managers the best of both worlds: the speed of vibe coding and the standards enterprises require. Bolt has already connected their apps to over 600,000 Supabase backends today.

## The enterprise developer problem

Enterprise developers and product managers face familiar challenges:

- **Endless error loops.** Quick demos often collapse under real-world traffic or audits. Supabase + Bolt ensure reliability from the start.
- **Half-wired backends.** Databases here, auth there, storage somewhere else — every integration adds friction and failure points. The Bolt agent wires everything up with Supabase built in.
- **Prototypes that stall.** Tools that accelerate early prototypes often fail at scale, forcing painful rewrites. Supabase scale plus Bolt Cloud means you can move fast without hitting a rewrite wall.

Enterprise teams need speed and reliability. Supabase bridges both. It's the Postgres development platform that lets you build in a weekend and scale to millions, with the performance, compliance, and observability enterprises demand. Bolt Cloud proves the same point: speed only matters if you can trust the foundation.

## Supabase and Bolt Cloud: build enterprise applications in minutes

Bolt Cloud projects that use Supabase as their backend let teams move fast on infrastructure already trusted by enterprises across industries:

- **[Postgres Database](/database).** Production-ready Postgres with extensions, scaling, and backups built in. No proprietary query languages, no migration headaches, just SQL.
- **[Supabase Auth](/auth).** Complete authentication and user management, including enterprise features like SAML and SSO, plus Row Level Security for granular access control.
- **[Supabase Storage](/storage).** S3-compatible object storage, built for handling user-generated content at scale.
- **[Supabase Edge Functions](/edge-functions).** Globally distributed functions for custom business logic, deployed close to your users.
- **[Realtime APIs](/realtime).** Postgres replication exposed as APIs, enabling collaboration and live data without additional infrastructure.

Because Supabase is just Postgres, enterprises can reuse their skills, connect existing systems through Foreign Data Wrappers, and trust technology proven at global scale.

## Enterprise standards included

Bolt Cloud projects built on Supabase meet enterprise requirements:

- SOC 2 and HIPAA certifications for compliance-driven industries
- Row Level Security for protecting sensitive data
- Read replicas and horizontal scaling for unpredictable traffic
- Point-in-time recovery and automatic backups for resilience

These are not afterthoughts. They are table stakes for enterprise scale. Supabase delivers them out of the box.

## Why this matters

_Build in a weekend_. _Scale to millions_. This isn't just a tagline. It's how we operate. It means balancing the need for teams to move fast with the requirement to act responsibly and safely. Supabase is not just for startups. Modern enterprise teams face equal pressure to move faster than ever.

Bolt Cloud shows how this vision works in practice. A modern frontend workflow can extend into a secure, scalable backend powered by Supabase. Enterprise developers can move at the speed of AI-assisted development without leaving behind the standards their organizations require.

## Start building

Supabase is more than a database. It is the fully integrated Postgres development platform that reduces complexity for developers and reduces risk for enterprises. Bolt Cloud highlights the same trend we built around: giving teams superpowers without compromise.

**For developers:** Easy tools, instant setup, and seamless integrations.

**For enterprises:** Compliance, reliability, and the ability to scale with confidence.

It is not a tradeoff anymore. The new generation of tools delivers both.
