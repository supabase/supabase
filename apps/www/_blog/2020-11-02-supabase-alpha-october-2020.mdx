We're now 8 months into building Supabase. We're focused on performance, stability, and reliability but that hasn't prevented us from shipping some great features.

### Supabase.js 1.0

In the lead-up to our Beta launch, we've [released](/blog/improved-dx) `supabase-js` version 1.0 and it comes with some major Developer Experience improvements. We received a lot of feedback from the community and we've incorporated it into our client libraries for our 1.0 release.

Check out the [blog post](/blog/improved-dx) to learn more.

### More powerful SQL Editor

Although it was only intended to be a temporary feature, the SQL Editor has become one of the most useful features of Supabase. This month we decided to make give it some attention, adding Tabs and making it full-screen. This is the first of many updates, we've got some exciting things planned for the SQL Editor.

### Key commands for Power Users

For the heavy table editor users, we've gone ahead and added a bunch of key commands and keyboard shortcuts so you can zip around and manipulate your tables faster than ever.

### Magic Links

One of the most requested Auth features was the ability to send magic links that your users can use to log in. You can use this with new or existing users, and alongside passwords or stand alone.

### Kaizen

- We have new and improved [docs](/docs/reference/javascript/installing).
- We converted [realtime-js](https://github.com/supabase/realtime-js/) to TypeScript.
- Dashboard Performance: we heavily optimised our dashboard routes.
- With the help of the community, we [closed a lot of issues](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/projects/5) during Hacktoberfest.
- We have started [benchmarking](https://github.com/supabase/benchmarks) all the open source tools we use. We'll publish the results this month.

### Community

### Coming next

Our focus is still moving from Alpha to Beta and we'll be improving stability, reliability, and performance. Our Supabase.js 1.0 launch was part of that, and we've created a [Benchmarks](https://github.com/supabase/benchmarks/) repository where we'll be measuring the performance of all the open source tools we use.
