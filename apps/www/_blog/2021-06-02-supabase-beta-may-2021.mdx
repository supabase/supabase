## Apple logins are now available

Did you know: if you ship an app to the App Store with any third-party logins, you're required to enable Apple logins as well? Now you can with Supabase Auth.

## Twitter logins are now available

You can also use Twitter as an OAuth provider with Supabase Auth. Twitter has a very archaic OAuth implementation, so this one took awhile.

## New storage policy editor

We shipped a new Policy Editor for managing Row Level Security on your Storage. We provide some templates to simplify the process for new developers.

## Supabase Grid

We are still working on Open Sourcing our Dashboard, and took another step closer by publicly releasing a new [Supabase Grid](https://github.com/supabase/grid). It's not ready to use outside of the Supabase ecosystem, but over time we hope to make it usable with any Postgres Database.

## Japan (Tokyo) 🇯🇵 is now available as a region

There are a huge number of Supabase developers in Japan and China, and at their request we've launched Tokyo as a region.

## Return data as CSV

You can now [retrieve your data](/docs/reference/javascript/select#return-data-as-csv) as Comma Separated Values. Thanks to [@andreivreja](https://github.com/andreivreja) for the [awesome PR](https://github.com/supabase/postgrest-js/pull/187).

## New Go Libraries

The community started developing the Go libraries. [postgrest-go](https://github.com/supabase/postgrest-go) is completed, [@Yusuf_Papurcu](https://twitter.com/Yusuf_Papurcu) and [@muratmirgun](https://twitter.com/muratmirgun) are working on the remaining libraries.

## New Swift Libraries

The community started developing the Swift libraries too. [@satishbabariya](https://twitter.com/satishbabariya) is making huge progress on
[`storage-swift`](https://github.com/supabase/storage-swift),
[`gotrue-swift`](https://github.com/supabase/gotrue-swift),
[`realtime-swift`](https://github.com/supabase/realtime-swift), and
[`supabase-swift`](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-swift).
