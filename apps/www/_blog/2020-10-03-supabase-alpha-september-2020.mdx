We're now 7 months into building Supabase. This update is a big one!

### Quick demo

Watch a full demo:

<div className="video-container">

    className="w-full"
    src="https://www.loom.com/embed/c7d66ae1f4c1458d964147c5c58aad59"

</div>

### Third-party logins

We've released OAuth logins! You can now enable third-party logins on your app for Bitbucket, GitHub, GitLab, or Google.

### Clone tables

You can duplicate your tables, just like you would inside a spreadsheet.

  />

### Enable and disable extensions

Extensions are easier to use. You can enable Postgres extensions with the click of a button.

  />

### Save your favorite queries

The SQL editor now stores your query history in your browser. You can also save your favorite queries to run later!

### GitHub Discussions

Supabase was given access to [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/discussions)! This is the place for you to ask questions or show off what you've built with Supabase.

### Kaizen

- Our dashboard now uses [Next.js automatic static optimization](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/automatic-static-optimization) - so it should be noticeably more responsive.
- We created an Isomorphic [`gotrue-js`](https://github.com/supabase/gotrue-js/) TypeScript library for interacting with Netlify's [GoTrue server](https://github.com/netlify/gotrue). This will soon be bundled into `supabase-js`
- We migrated our [`postgrest-js`](https://github.com/supabase/postgrest-js/) library to TypeScript, and it will soon be bundled into `supabase-js`

### Hacktoberfest

There's been [plenty of drama](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/hacktoberfest-update) during Hacktoberfest, but Supabase is committed to helping new contributors get started with open source. We've already seen a lot of issues closed by new members to our community and first-time contributors. If you're looking for ways to get involved, read our Hacktoberfest [blog post](/blog/supabase-hacktoberfest-2020), check our [live stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_xRLTjvEiE&t=60s), and then dive into our [project board](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/projects/5).

### Coming next

Our focus now is to move from Alpha to Beta and we'll be improving stability, reliability, and performance. We've created a [Benchmarks](https://github.com/supabase/benchmarks/) repository, where we'll be measuring the performance of all the open source tools we use.
