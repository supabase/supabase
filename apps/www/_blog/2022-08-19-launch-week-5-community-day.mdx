Supabase combines existing open-source tools with our own open-source contributions to provide a delightful experience for developers of all skill levels. Just as versatile as our platform, we're building a community of communities, bringing together developers from many different backgrounds, as well as new developers looking to get involved with open source.

To wrap up Launch Week 5, we're showcasing some of the communities and contributors that make up the Supabase community, highlighting their awesome work, and celebrating everyone who contributes their time to the Supabase mission. 💚

## Launch Week 5 - a new era?!

If you're an avid Launch Week participant, you might have been surprised this time because we usually kick-off with Community Day on Mondays.
And we previously closed Launch Week with a bunch more things on Friday, and the start of our virtual Hackathon.

This time, we're switching things around:

- [Monday to Thursday](/launch-week) are the big-ticket launches.
- Friday, we highlight all the additional “one more thing(s)” that we've launched, as well as shine a light on our awesome community contributions.
- As you [might have noticed](/blog/launch-week-5-hackathon), we now run our virtual Hackathon throughout Launch Week, and as always you can win some awesome limited edition swag, and for the first time ever, there's a $1500 GitHub sponsorship awarded to the best overall project!

### Launch Week Landing Page & Golden Tickets

    allowfullscreen
  ></iframe>
</div>

We now have a shiny new [Launch Week page](https://supabase.com/launch-week), your one-stop shop for all things Launch Week, where you can find each day's feature as well as highlights from the past Launch Weeks.

We've taken a page out of [Vercel's Virtual Events Starter Kit](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/virtual-event-starter-kit), and generated over 3000 virtual tickets. Thank you all for participating, we love [seeing your tickets on Twitter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/SupaLaunchWeek?src=hashtag_click&f=live)! To make this work, we've adapted the Virtual Events Starter Kit and [added in a Supabase Database provider](https://github.com/vercel/virtual-event-starter-kit/pull/88) as an alternative to the Redis database option.

We've added a Golden Ticket mechanic, distributing some special edition launch week swag to some lucky winners. If you're interested in how we've built this, check out the video above with a brief explanation.

## Integrations, Expert Partners, and Developer Stories

Since releasing our [Partners](/partners) page last Launch Week, we've had a lot of new partners reach out to join the community.

### CodeSandbox Projects Beta

</div>

The new [CodeSandbox Projects Beta](https://projects.codesandbox.io/) let's you run your projects and turn them into a link you can share with anyone. Developers visiting your link can not only see your running code, they can click “fork” and get an exact copy of that environment so they can easily contribute back to your masterpiece. CodeSandbox integrates directly with GitHub, so you get a unique development environment for every PR you and your contributors open!

You can do all of this from a web browser, from [within VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CodeSandbox-io.codesandbox-projects), or via the [native iPad app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/codesandbox/id1423330822)! Give it a try with the [Supabase example project](https://codesandbox.io/p/github/codesandbox/codesandbox-supabase-example/main?file=%2FREADME.md)!
