Today we're launching a new [GitHub Copilot extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Supabase.vscode-supabase-extension) to make your development with Supabase and VS Code even more delightful, starting with a Copilot-guided experience for [database migrations](/docs/guides/cli/local-development#database-migrations).

The foundation for this extension was created by [Anas Araid](https://github.com/anas-araid) during a previous [Launch Week Hackathon](https://twitter.com/anas_araid/status/1736641409094988033). Impressed with their work, we partnered with them to add a ["Chat Participant"](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/chat), an exciting [new feature recently launched](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2024/06/24/extensions-are-all-you-need) by the GitHub and VS Code teams at Microsoft.

## Features

The VS Code extension is quite feature rich:

### GitHub Copilot Chat Participant

The extension provides a [Chat Participant](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/chat) for GitHub Copilot to help with your Supabase questions. Simply type `@supabase` in your Copilot Chat and the extension will include your database schema as context to Copilot.

### Copilot-guided database migrations

The extension provides a guided experience to create and apply [database migrations](/docs/guides/cli/local-development#database-migrations). Simply type `@supabase /migration <describe what you want to do>` in your Copilot Chat and the extension will generate a new SQL migration for you.

## What's Next?

We're excited to continue adding more features that will make your development experience with Supabase even more delightful - and for this we need your help! If you have any feedback, feature requests, or bug reports, please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/supabase-community/supabase-vscode-extension/issues).

The extension requires you to have the Supabase CLI installed and have your project running locally. In a future release, we will integrate the [Supabase Managamenet API](/docs/reference/api/introduction) into the extension to make connecting to your hosted Supabase projects as seamless as possible.

## Contributing to Supabase

The entire Supabase stack is [fully open source](/open-source), including [this extension](https://github.com/supabase-community/supabase-vscode-extension).
