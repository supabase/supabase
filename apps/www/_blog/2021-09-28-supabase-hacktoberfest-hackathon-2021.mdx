# Supabase Hacktoberfest Hackathon 2021

We were absolutely blown away by [all the amazing projects](/blog/hackathon-winners) you built during our [first Supabase Hackathon](/blog/1-the-supabase-hackathon), that we were looking for an excuse to run our next virtual open-source hackathon, and we found it in the upcoming [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/).

## Here's the plan

- On **Friday Oct 1st at 08:00am PT** we're kicking things off with our Hacktoberfest Discord Hangout. Join us in the #hackathon channel on our Discord server: [https://discord.gg/bnncdqgBSS](https://discord.gg/bnncdqgBSS)
- Then you have 10 days to build a new **open-source** project with Supabase or contribute to one of our [supabase-community projects](https://github.com/supabase-community?q=topic%3AHacktoberfest&type=&language=&sort=) that have the `hacktoberfest` topic.
- It can be whatever you want - a project, mobile app, tool, library, anything
- Enter as an individual, or as a team of up to 5 people
- Submission deadline is **Sunday Oct 10th at 11:59pm PT**
- Besides [earning your Hacktoberfest shirt](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/resources/participation), you can win some extremely limited edition Supabase swag âœ¨ (see [here](https://twitter.com/supabase/status/1440737587895799809?s=21) what folks won last time!)
