By now you probably know the drill. Supabase Launch Week: we launch one thing, or sometimes a couple,
every day for an entire week.

If this is your first Launch Week, check out our previous Launch Weeks for a taste of what's to come:

- [Launch Week II: The SQL](/blog/supabase-launch-week-sql)
- [Launch Week III: The Trilogy](/blog/supabase-launch-week-the-trilogy)

## What to expect

Launch Week Four has something for everybody.

We don't want to spoil the surprise, so for now we'll give you a teaser for each day.

### What?

Absolutely, definitely not an April Fool's joke. Friday is reserved for ‚Äúone more thing(s)‚Äù -
a secret announcement of some sort. There's always too much to ship in a week, so let's be honest -
it's never really just _one_ more thing.

![Untitled](/images/blog/launch-week-4/friday-before/dino.png)

### What

Finally, we're continuing our tradition of wrapping up Launch Week by rolling into a 10-day virtual Hackathon.
As always, you'll have the chance to win extremely limited Supabase Swag,

We're also delighted to be partnering with [the future forest company](https://thefutureforestcompany.com/)
to plant a tree for every project that is being submitted for the Hackathon.
So let's build some cool open-source projects and a forest at the same time!

### When

Friday 1 April 2022: 9:00am PT - Sunday 9 April 11:59pm PT

### Where

We're extremely excited to see what you'll build and can't wait to dive into your submissions on
[madewithsupabase.com](https://www.madewithsupabase.com/).
