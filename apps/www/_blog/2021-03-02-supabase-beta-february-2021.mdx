Supabase is an open source Firebase alternative. We've now been building for one year. Here's what we released last month.

### Quick demo

Watch a full demo:

<div className="video-container">
  <iframe
    className="video-with-border w-full"
    src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/h-ses99G45g"
    frameBorder="1"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowFullScreen
  ></iframe>
</div>

### Dashboard Sidebars

We've improved the UX of our Dashboard with sidebars in every section, including the Table view, the Auth section, and the SQL Editor.

### SQL Autocomplete

Writing SQL just got 10x easier. We added autocomplete to the SQL editor, including table & column suggestions.

### Auth Redirects

Redirect your users to specific route within your site on [`signIn()`](/docs/reference/javascript/v1/auth-signin#sign-in-with-redirect) and [`signUp()`](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signup#sign-up-with-redirect).

### Replication management

We added a page to the Database section for managing Postgres Replication. It's still basic, but you can use it to manage your realtime API - choosing which tables are enabled, and which events to send.

### Learning Resources

We've released a new [Resources](/docs/resources) section in our docs, as well as two new Auth modules: [GoTrue Overview](/docs/learn/auth-deep-dive/auth-gotrue) and [Google OAuth](/docs/learn/auth-deep-dive/auth-google-oauth).

### New Region

Launch your database in South Africa.

### Kaizen

- We filled up our [Examples](/docs/guides/examples) page with a lot of new content.
- We released a [Docker Compose](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/master/docker/docker-compose.yml) file for running Supabase locally. This will be used in our upcoming CLI.
- We have a couple of pending RFCs which you may want to participate in:
  - [Planning our CLI and Local Development](https://github.com/supabase/cli/pull/2)
  - [Connection Pooling on Supabase](https://github.com/supabase/postgres/blob/rfc/connection_pooling/rfcs/0001-connection-pooling.md)

### Community

One of the community, [@ftonato](https://github.com/ftonato), has built an amazing [example](https://github.com/supabase/examples/tree/main/supabase-js-v1/with-stencil) that shows how to use Supabase with [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/) (a Web Component compiler built by they [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/) team.)

[Check it out!](https://github.com/supabase/examples/tree/main/supabase-js-v1/with-stencil)
