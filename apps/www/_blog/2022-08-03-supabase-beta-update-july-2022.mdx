There was so much stuff happening during June that we had to cut some updates from the newsletter! But don't worry, we are doing an extended version for the blog post, so go ahead and read on!

## Launch Week Golden Ticket

## Supabase Flutter SDK 1.0 developer preview

Head on over to project settings to pause and restore projects on demand. This new feature gives you virtually unlimited free projects, so you can build as many things as you want. Want to experiment? Build a new demo? Just pause a project and start a new one. [Check the PR](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/pull/7384).

## Revamped Auth Helpers (now with SvelteKit support)

It's here! Now you can create a project from the Supabase CLI. We will be extending the CLI with more features to manage your project, so stay tuned! [See the doc](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/cli/supabase-projects-create).

## pg_jsonschema â€“ A Postgres extension for JSON validation
