We're very excited to announce [Supabase Storage](https://supabase.com/storage) is getting better for everyone. We are

- Increasing the maximum file size to 500 GB, up from 50GB
- Reducing egress costs for requests cached by our API Gateway is charged at 3c/GB, down from 9c/GB
- Free plans get 5GB of cached egress in addition to 5GB of uncached egress. All paid plans get 250GB of cached egress and 250 GB of uncached egress, bundled in.

The 500 GB limit for individual files is available for all paid plans, effective today. Lower cached egress pricing and increased quotas for cached egress will be rolling out to all users over the next 2 weeks and will take effect at the end of your current billing cycle. This should be a price reduction for all users for Storage.

## 10x Larger Uploads

Our community has asked for better support for increasingly large files, from high resolution video platforms and media heavy applications to SaaS platforms handling user generated data, storing 3D models and data archival.

We have made several optimizations to our platform infrastructure and API gateway to ensure reliable handling of very large files, allowing us to increase the limit from 50 GB to 500 GB for all paid plans.

To take full advantage of this feature, set the new upload size limit [here](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/storage) and use the new storage-specific hostname for your uploads. You can do this by adding `storage` after your project ref in the standard Supabase url. Replace `project-ref.supabase.co` with `project-ref.storage.supabase.co` . The older URL format will continue to work.

For uploading large files, we recommend using one of our multipart upload options:

- [**Resumable uploads using TUS**](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage/uploads/resumable-uploads) - Perfect for cases where network interruptions might occur, allowing uploads to resume from where they left off
- [**S3 protocol multipart uploads**](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage/uploads/s3-uploads) - Ideal for applications that need S3-compatible upload workflows

Both approaches automatically handle breaking large files into manageable chunks during upload while presenting them as single objects for download.

## 3x Cheaper Cached Egress

All Supabase traffic flows through our API Gateway, which also functions as a content delivery network (CDN). When an asset is cached at the edge (and frequently accessed storage objects typically are), the CDN delivers it immediately. If it isn't cached, the request is forwarded to the region hosting your Supabase project before returning to the user.

Initially, we leant towards keeping our pricing model simple instead of reflecting regional and cache-status variations in egress costs. This unfortunately meant that customers with very high cached storage bandwidth couldn't benefit from our lower cached egress rates.

Today, we are introducing a new pricing line item and are able to offer cached egress at a much lower rate of 3c/GB. Combined with the [Smart CDN for storage](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage/cdn/smart-cdn), which increases the cache hit rate for storage significantly, this would significantly reduce egress bill for our largest storage users.

## 2x Egress Quota

Paid plans previously included 250 GB of unified egress. We've now split that into 250 GB of cached egress and 250 GB of uncached egress, so customers with high cache hit rates effectively get twice the free egress. Free plans now include 5 GB of cached egress alongside 5 GB of uncached egress.
