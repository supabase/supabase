For September we made a huge effort to focus on crushing our backlog and outstanding tickets amongst other things, here's the full list of updates for the month...

## Kaizen Week

Post Launch Week we did three subsequent weeks of [Kaizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen), a term we use internally to deliver constant and incremental improvement. Each week had a different focus:

-   Week 1: QA and testing
-   Week 2: Documentation
-   Week 3: Issue Backlog and Automation

It's pretty rare for a company to stop feature development altogether, but luckily we're just a bunch of developers so we all know the pain of technical debt. After 5 Launch Weeks, working on testing and backlogs feels like a bit of a relief.

We saw a lot of progress across our Open Issues - closing over 250 issues and 50 Pull Requests.

and we shipped a few things:

## Auth UI on Product Hunt

We launched the new Auth UI on Product Hunt! Auth UI is a pre-built React component for authenticating users with Supabase Auth. It supports custom themes and extensible styles to match your brand and aesthetic.

## Postgres WASM

If you've ever wondered, "can I run Postgres inside a browser, using an embeddable Linux Virtual Machine?", wonder no longer. With our friends at [Snaplet](https://www.snaplet.dev/?utm_campaign=Beta%20update%20emails&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8u0x9grbiydYqh56hC_8Dta4ZiTdWbW0eXWkVCnUEUGWWoVDFXCpWzJWImkLfM-lG-o2JX), we've released an open source Postgres WASM.

## Security updates

We're making some changes to the way the Dashboard interacts with your database. These changes simplify the database permissions so that it's easier for you to migrate in and out of Supabase, and they reduce the security surface area considerably. The change will be applied automatically in November, or you can run it today via the Dashboard.

[Review the Security Notice](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/discussions/9314).

## Quick product updates

- Edge functions free plan script size is bumped to 2 MB
- [functions-go](https://github.com/supabase-community/functions-go) was just contributed to supabase-community by [Zain Khan](https://twitter.com/Za1n_K)
- A new [guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-captcha) to add captcha to your sign-in, sign-up, and password reset forms
- New Postgres Extension for monitoring your PostgreSQL database network traffic: [pg_netstat](https://github.com/supabase/pg_netstat)
- Added [docs](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage-cdn) for how caching works in Supabase

## Migrate from Heroku to Supabase

![Migrate from Heroku to Supabase](/images/blog/2022-september/migrate-from-heroku-to-supabase.jpg)

In case you missed it, Heroku is shutting down their free tier. We're big fans of Heroku and take a lot of inspiration from what they've built. Supabase is compatible with Heroku's PostgreSQL product (because we're just Postgres too), and if you have a free project running on Heroku we've created a [tool to help migrate](https://migrate.supabase.com/) to our free tier.

## Made with Supabase

![Made with Supabase - Supabase Schema](/images/blog/2022-september/madewithsupabase.jpg)

Simply plug in your URL and anon key and see a visual representation of your database schema! Built by the amazing [Zernonia](https://twitter.com/zernonia) using Vue 3, Viti, and WindiCSS.
