Get your app ready for production.

Vibe coding has transformed how we build software. AI-powered tools like [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/), [Bolt](https://bolt.new/), [v0](https://v0.app/), [Figma Make](https://www.figma.com/make/), and others let you describe your app in plain language and watch it come to life. You can go from idea to working prototype faster than ever before.

But getting an app to "work" and getting it ready for real users are two different challenges. Your weekend prototype needs security hardening, performance optimization, and deployment planning before it can handle actual traffic and protect user data.

This guide covers the essential steps to bridge that gap. You'll learn how to audit your AI-generated code, optimize for production, and deploy with confidence. Whether you built with these or another tool, these practices will help you ship something users can actually rely on.

## Why Supabase works so well for vibe coders

When you're building with AI tools, you want to focus on your app's unique features, not wrestle with backend infrastructure. That's where Supabase shines as the ideal foundation for vibe-coded applications.

Unlike piecing together separate services for your [database](https://supabase.com/database), [authentication](https://supabase.com/auth), [storage](https://supabase.com/storage), [edge functions](https://supabase.com/edge-functions), and more, Supabase gives you everything integrated from the start. Your AI tool can request "Supabase Auth for user management" and immediately get secure authentication with social logins, magic links, and proper session handling. No configuration headaches or security gaps.

The same integration applies across the platform. Your database, real-time subscriptions, file storage, and edge functions all work together seamlessly. When your AI-generated code needs to store user files, implement real-time features, or run server-side logic, these components communicate naturally without custom integration work.

Tight integration serves the needs of developers of all skill levels and applications of all levels of sophistication, but solo developers and small teams especially benefit from the time and effort saved. Authentication, for example, is notoriously complex to implement securely. With Supabase Auth, you get enterprise-grade security features like Row Level Security, proper password hashing, and session management built in. Your AI tool can focus on your app's business logic while Supabase handles the infrastructure.

The platform's Postgres foundation means you're building on proven, scalable technology from day one. As your vibe-coded weekend project grows, you won't hit arbitrary limits or need to migrate to "real" infrastructure. The same database that powers your prototype can scale to millions of users.

For vibe coders specifically, this integration eliminates the biggest obstacle between prototype and production: the backend complexity that AI tools often struggle with. Your generated frontend code works immediately with Supabase's auto-generated APIs, and security, performance, and reliability features are available when you need them, not bolted on as an afterthought.

## The prototype to production gap

AI tools excel at creating functional demos quickly. They generate working code, set up databases, and handle basic user flows. But they prioritize speed over production concerns like security, scalability, and maintainability.

Common gaps include hard-coded API keys in frontend code, missing input validation and error handling, unoptimized database queries and large bundle sizes, basic authentication without proper security controls, and no monitoring, backups, or disaster recovery.

The good news? You can address these systematically without starting over.

## Security audit and hardening

Security should be your first priority when moving to production. Start by testing your app's basic security controls.

### Authentication and authorization review

Test your login system thoroughly. Try accessing private pages while logged out by typing URLs directly into your browser. If your app has different user roles (such as "admin", "member", or "visitor"), create test accounts for each and verify they only see appropriate content.

When working with your AI tool, request specific security features: "implement secure password storage," "add session timeouts," and "ensure proper logout functionality." Tools like Supabase Auth handle these concerns automatically, letting you focus on your application rather than security infrastructure.

### Input validation and data protection

Your app should validate all user input before processing it. This means checking that email fields contain valid email formats and that numeric fields only accept numbers. It also prevents attackers from injecting malicious code through form submissions.

Ask your AI tool to "review all form inputs for proper validation and sanitization" to address this systematically.

### API security and secrets management

Check that sensitive information like API keys aren't exposed in your frontend code. Open your browser's developer tools, go to the Network tab, and click around your app to see what requests it makes. Look for exposed passwords or personal data, and test whether rapid repeated requests might overwhelm your system.

One critical issue: some AI tools embed API keys directly in code that users can access. This creates serious security risks. Request that your tool "scan the codebase for exposed API keys and move them to environment variables."

### Database security

Your database needs protection at multiple levels. If you're using Supabase, implement Row Level Security (RLS) to ensure users only access their own data. Test this by logging in as different users and confirming they can't see each other's information.

Request "Row Level Security policies" and "user data isolation" when working with AI tools. Check Supabase's RLS documentation for specific implementation guidance.

### Security checklist and prompt

Use this comprehensive approach when you're ready to audit your application's security:

**Essential security tasks:**

- Test authentication flow (login/logout multiple times, test private URLs when logged out)
- Validate user inputs (review all forms for proper validation and sanitization)
- Secure API endpoints (inspect requests in Network tab, test rate limiting)
- Protect credentials (scan for exposed API keys, move to environment variables)
- Implement database security (enable RLS, test user data isolation)

**Security audit prompt:**

```
Conduct a comprehensive security audit of my application and implement these measures:

Authentication & Access Control:
- Ensure secure password storage with proper hashing
- Add session timeouts and proper logout functionality
- Implement user role restrictions and data isolation
- Use Supabase Auth for authentication handling

Data Protection:
- Enable Row Level Security (RLS) policies for user data (especially for Supabase)
- Review all form inputs for proper validation and sanitization
- Add rate limiting to prevent spam attacks

Application Security:
- Implement error handling that doesn't reveal sensitive information
- Hide database connection details from users
- Scan for API keys in frontend components and move to environment variables

Provide a summary of specific changes made to improve security.

```

## Data modeling and management

Well-structured data becomes more important as your app grows. Your database should organize information logically and handle validation automatically.

### Schema design and relationships

Most apps organize data into related tables. A restaurant review app might have separate tables for users, restaurants, and reviews, with clear connections between them. This structure makes your app easier to maintain and query efficiently.

Ask your AI tool to review your database schema for proper relationships, constraints, and data types. Well-designed schemas prevent data corruption and make future changes easier.

### Data validation and backups

Set appropriate data types for your database columns. If a field should only contain whole numbers, use an integer type. This ensures your application always receives predictable data formats.

Also verify that automated backups are enabled. Most managed database services, including Supabase, offer automatic backup configuration to protect against data loss.

### Database checklist and optimization

**Key database tasks:**

- Review database schema (check tables, relationships, constraints)
- Optimize queries (add indexes for frequently queried columns)
- Configure backups (enable automatic database backups)
- Plan for growth (design schema for future changes)

**Database optimization prompt:**

```
Review my database schema and ensure it includes:

Structure & Relationships:
- Proper table relationships with primary/foreign keys
- Normalized structure avoiding data duplication
- Junction tables for many-to-many relationships

Data Integrity:
- Unique constraints on emails, usernames, phone numbers
- NOT NULL requirements where appropriate
- Proper data types and validation rules

Performance & Maintenance:
- Indexes on frequently queried columns
- Migration planning for future schema changes
- Backup and recovery configuration

Explain the architectural decisions and suggest improvements.

```

## Performance and user experience

Performance directly impacts user satisfaction. Slow apps frustrate users and hurt conversion rates.

### Speed optimization

Run your app through Google's PageSpeed Insights to get specific performance metrics and recommendations. This tool identifies exactly what's slowing down your app and provides actionable suggestions.

Common performance issues include oversized images, unused JavaScript, and slow database queries. Your AI tool can address these systematically when given specific feedback from PageSpeed.

### Database performance

If your app feels sluggish despite a fast interface, database queries might be the bottleneck. Ask your AI tool to analyze query performance and add indexes where needed. Indexes make frequently accessed data much faster to retrieve.

### User experience improvements

Click through your app and note any confusing interactions or slow responses. Take screenshots of problem areas to give your AI tool visual context when requesting fixes.

Focus on clear error messages, consistent navigation, and mobile responsiveness. These improvements don't fix "bugs" but significantly impact usability.

### Performance checklist and optimization

**Performance priorities:**

- Audit loading speed (run PageSpeed Insights, implement recommendations)
- Optimize database queries (debug slow queries, add appropriate indexes)
- Optimize assets (compress images, implement lazy loading, minimize bundles)
- Improve user experience (add loading states, test mobile performance)

**Performance optimization prompt:**

```
My application needs performance optimization. Here's my PageSpeed data:

[Include your specific PageSpeed results here]

Implement optimizations in this order:

1. Image Optimization
   - Compress large images (target ≤100KB where possible)
   - Implement lazy loading for off-screen images
   - Use modern formats like WebP where supported

2. Code Optimization
   - Remove unused JavaScript and CSS
   - Minify remaining files
   - Split large bundles into smaller chunks

3. Loading Improvements
   - Add loading states for async operations
   - Implement pagination for large data sets
   - Reduce layout shifts with proper sizing

For each optimization:
1. Identify the specific issue in my code
2. Show the updated implementation
3. Explain the performance benefit
4. Estimate the PageSpeed improvement

Work through these systematically, confirming each stage before proceeding.

```

## Deployment best practices

Moving from development to production requires careful environment configuration and monitoring.

### Environment setup

Your app should behave differently in development and production. Development might show detailed error messages for debugging, while production should hide these for security. Set up separate environment configurations and store sensitive information like API keys in environment variables, not in your code.

Most deployment platforms like Vercel and Netlify handle environment variables through their dashboards, making secret management straightforward.

### Error handling and monitoring

Implement proper error boundaries so your app gracefully handles problems rather than crashing. Users should see helpful messages like "Sorry, we couldn't update your account" instead of technical error codes.

Ask your AI tool to "implement error boundaries and user-friendly error pages" along with "basic performance monitoring and error tracking."

### Automated deployment

Set up automatic deployment from your code repository so updates go live without manual work. When you push code changes to GitHub, platforms like Vercel can automatically build and deploy your app.

Request "automatic deployment from GitHub" and "basic testing before deployment" to ensure smooth updates.

### Deployment checklist and preparation

**Deployment essentials:**

- Configure environments (set up development and production configurations)
- Handle errors gracefully (add error boundaries and user-friendly error pages)
- Set up monitoring (add performance and error tracking)
- Optimize for search (add proper meta tags and SEO elements)

**Deployment preparation prompt:**

```
Prepare my application for production deployment:

Current Setup:
- Built with [your AI tool]
- Using Supabase for backend/database
- Deploying to [Vercel/Netlify/other]
- Custom domain: [yourdomain.com]

Implementation Steps:

1. Environment Configuration
   - Move hard-coded config to environment variables
   - Set up production vs. development environments
   - Configure deployment platform settings

2. Error Handling & UX
   - Add error boundaries for component crashes
   - Create user-friendly error pages (404, 500, network errors)
   - Implement loading states for all async operations

3. Production Optimization
   - Optimize images and assets
   - Remove development code and console.logs
   - Add proper meta tags for SEO
   - Ensure responsive design works on all devices

4. Monitoring & Deployment
   - Set up error tracking and basic analytics
   - Configure automatic deployment from GitHub
   - Test custom domain and SSL setup

For each step, provide:
1. Exact code changes needed
2. Platform configuration settings
3. Simple test to verify functionality
4. Troubleshooting guidance

Conclude with a final production checklist.

```
