During [Launch Week 5](https://supabase.com/launch-week), we shipped a lot of features, which was exciting, but what is more exciting is reviewing all the awesome hackathon submissions you all created for [Launch Week 5 Hackathon!](https://supabase.com/blog/launch-week-5-hackathon)

It is always tough to pick the winner, but this time around it was extra hard because of the amount of incredible projects: there were 46 submitted projects, making this our most popular hackathon yet. You will be able to view all of the submissions of this hackathon on [madewithsupabase.com](https://www.madewithsupabase.com/).
