Supabase has raised a Series E from insiders, led by Accel and Peak XV. Figma has joined the round with all of existing investors: YC, Coatue, Felicis, Craft, and Square Peg.

We raised $100M at a $5B pre-money valuation. One of the ways we will use the money is for employee secondaries: every single round we have allowed our employees to sell 25% of their vested stock. This round is no different, and we will continue to do this for future rounds.

Additionally, we are accelerating hiring for key open source initiatives like [Multigres](https://supabase.com/blog/multigres-vitess-for-postgres) and [OrioleDB](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-acquires-oriole). Supabase is home to over 30 ex-founders. We are 100% distributed, with no offices, spread across 37 countries. We are a group of humans who are focused on doing their best work. If that sounds like a place you want to work, apply today:

One more thing: our community continues to grow it’s one of the things Ant & I are most proud of. This time, we wanted to allow Supabase and Postgres contributors to invest. In the coming months we will do a $1M community round open to early customers and contributors.
