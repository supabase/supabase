We've been hard at work making an Auth experience that is as smooth as possible for Supabase developers. One of the challenges has been creating a simple experience for server-side rendering (SSR) environments. We [previously released](https://supabase.com/blog/2022/03/28/community-day#server-side-auth-for-nextjs-and-nuxt-sveltekit-and-remix-coming-soon) our Auth Helpers libraries with support for React and NextJS, and today we’re announcing some exciting updates.

### What are Auth Helpers?

Auth Helpers are a collection of framework-specific utilities for Supabase Auth. They allow you to implement secure applications with little effort. These libraries include functions for protecting API routes and pages in your applications.

### SvelteKit support

Today, we’re adding support for SvelteKit. We’ve tried to keep the library’s interface similar to the other frameworks. This makes transitioning between frameworks seamless. You can follow our [step by step guide](https://github.com/supabase-community/auth-helpers/tree/main/packages/sveltekit) on how to get this setup.

### Name change

We’ve changed the name from `@supabase/supabase-auth-helpers` to `@supabase/auth-helpers`. With this change we:

- **Reset to a sub `0.x` version number.** This makes sense given that SvelteKit itself is still pre-1.0. And being pre-1.0 helps to manage expectations for future breaking changes.
- **Removed an extra “supabase”.** We realized that the namespace already contained `supabase` in it and we didn’t want to double up (naming is hard!).

### GitHub structure

We’ve moved the Auth Helpers into a monorepo so that we can publish packages individually rather than using the same package name for every framework. Each package only includes relevant dependencies - (eg, Next.js helpers don’t include SvelteKit dependencies).

We use [Turborepo](https://turborepo.org/) for managing our monorepo pipelines and have been incredibly pleased with its caching and performance. For packaging, we use [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) and GitHub Actions to create the release and publish to the npm registry. Each library lives in its own directory inside of the **[packages** directory](https://github.com/supabase-community/auth-helpers/tree/main/packages), with an accompanying example application making use of the library inside the **[examples** directory](https://github.com/supabase-community/auth-helpers/tree/main/examples).

### Migration path

We minimized the breaking changes as much as possible, but there were a few that were necessary. With that in mind we have provided a guide for migrating away from the old `@supabase/supabase-auth-helpers` library over to [the new `@supabase/auth-helpers` library](https://github.com/supabase-community/auth-helpers/tree/main/packages/nextjs#migrating-from-supabasesupabase-auth-helpers-to-supabaseauth-helpers).

### Examples available

Having good documentation is great, especially when there are [examples](https://github.com/supabase-community/auth-helpers/tree/main/examples) to augment. We’re always looking for community support in expanding our list of examples. If you have an interesting use case that you thing others may benefit from please consider contributing it.

### Coming soon

Remix Auth Helpers are in the works. You can follow the development of this on our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/supabase-community/auth-helpers), or subscribe to our Supabase YouTube channel as we build it live on air.
