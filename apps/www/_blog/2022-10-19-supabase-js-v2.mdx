During our [last Launch Week](/launch-week) we presented the [release candidate for supabase-js v2](/blog/supabase-js-v2). Since then we've been busy incorporating your feedback, [updating the docs](/docs/reference/javascript/), [examples](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/tree/master/examples), [quickstart guides](/docs/guides/with-nextjs), and putting a [migration guide]() together.

It truly takes a village, well, in this case an entire community, and we want to thank you all for your feedback, and contributions!

Version 2.0 is the result of the combined work of over 100 contributors to our libraries, and over 450 contributors to our docs and websites.
If you're one of those contributors, thank you!
