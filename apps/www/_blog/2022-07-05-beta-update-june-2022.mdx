We‚Äôre getting to a point where we need an overflow post, there are now too many product and community updates to include in a single email! Here‚Äôs the stuff that made the cut this month‚Ä¶

## Auth Helpers for Next.js revamped

![Auth Helpers for Next.js](/images/blog/2022-june/auth-helpers.png)

Supabase Auth Helpers are a collection of framework specific Auth utilities for getting user authentication and authorization set up in seconds. We have now separated the libraries into their own packages, which can now be installed individually: @supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs and @supabase/auth-helpers-react.

And here is a step by step migration guide. Sveltekit and Remix helpers coming soon!

## Unlimited free projects

Head on over to project settings to pause and restore projects on demand. This new feature gives you virtually unlimited free projects, so you can build as many things as you want. Want to experiment? Build a new demo? Just pause a project and start a new one. Check the PR.

## Create projects from the Supabase CLI
