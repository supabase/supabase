## We raised $30 million

Hot off the press, we raised our Series A.
We'll use the funds to do more of the same - ship features and hire open source developers.
We'll release more details soon. Read more on [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/supabase-raises-30m-for-its-open-source-insta-backend/).

## Realtime Security, codename: WALRUS

If you've been waiting for Row Level Security to land in Postgres [subscriptions](/docs/reference/javascript/subscribe),
then you're going to love our new repo:
[Write Ahead Log Realtime Unified Security (WALRUS)](https://github.com/supabase/walrus).
The name might be a bit forced, but the security design is deliberate.
It's not in production yet, but we're making the repo public for comments using an
[RFC process](https://github.com/supabase/walrus/blob/master/README.md#rfc-process).

## Custom SMS templates

If you're using SMS login in [Auth v2](/blog/2021/07/28/supabase-auth-passwordless-sms-login), you can now customize the SMS which is sent to your users. Read more in the [docs](/docs/guides/auth/phone-login/twilio#sms-custom-template).

## Dart and Flutter Docs

Thanks entirely to [@dshukertjr](https://twitter.com/dshukertjr), we now have in-depth [reference Dart documentation](/docs/reference/dart/installing) for CRUD, Auth, Realtime and more!

## We launched the South Korea region

We added another region for those wanting to host their data and APIs in Seoul. We now have 12 regions to choose from

## Table creation is even easier

You can now create columns while creating your table. We've also added improvements for composite primary keys and foreign key creation.

## Unbreakable CSV Imports

Our previous importer would choke on CSV files which were too large. Not any more!

## Connection strings

We now provide a handy copy utility for various database connection strings because we were so tired of looking them up on Stack Overflow.

## We released a primer on Row Level Security

RLS can be a bit foreign for developers getting started with Postgres.

## Community

### We had a community Hackathon

We held a one-week async Hackathon. Check out [all the winners](/blog/hackathon-winners) - it was truly impressive what people were able to build in just 7 days.

### We had a team Hackathon

The Supabase team didn't want to miss out on the fun so we held our own hackathon. It was a good way to dog food. Some notable projects include

- [Supaflix](https://supaflix.vercel.app/) by [@abc3](https://twitter.com/abc3erl) [[GitHub](https://github.com/abc3/supaflix)] - a Netflix clone build with Supabase
- [Personal-Casts](https://github.com/inian/personal-casts) by [@everconfusedguy](https://twitter.com/everconfusedguy) [[GitHub](https://github.com/inian/personal-casts)] - converts Youtube videos and articles into a personal podcast feed.
- And it wouldn't be a Supabase hackathon without a high-effort meme entry.

### GitHub Trending

We hit 18,000 stars on GitHub, and got to the [top of GitHub trending](https://twitter.com/supabase/status/1435868863518760964) for Typescript.

## Coming Next

Last December we [moved from Alpha to Beta](/beta), with a focus on Security, Performance, and Reliability. After a couple of Launch Weeks pushing out new and sexy features, we have decided it's time to focus on these again.

By the time we're done, Supabase will be production-ready for all use cases.
