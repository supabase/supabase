To cool down from [our latest launch week](/blog/supabase-launch-week-four) we (virtually) sat down with y'all and started hacking, and once again we absolutely loved your hackathon submissions and are excited to send some extremely limited swag your way and plant some trees for each of your submitted projects!

As always, it was challenging to pick the winners from all the great submissions! You can see all the amazing projects submitted on [madewithsupabase.com](https://www.madewithsupabase.com/bring-the-func). And now, without further ado, let's look at some of our favourites in more detail:
