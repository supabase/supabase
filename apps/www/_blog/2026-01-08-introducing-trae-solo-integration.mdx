Today we're excited to announce the availability of Supabase integration inside the TRAE IDE. [TRAE](https://www.trae.ai) is a leading AI IDE from ByteDance, designed to be a productivity partner for developers. It supports the full software development lifecycle, from everyday code completion to complex engineering tasks. After connecting Supabase to TRAE, you can manage your entire backend infrastructure without leaving the IDE.

TRAE SOLO and Supabase share a common philosophy: help developers move from idea to production as quickly as possible. The integration removes context switching between your IDE and backend dashboard, letting you stay focused on building.

## What is TRAE?

Since its launch in January 2025, TRAE has reached over 6 million registered users across nearly 200 countries, with an active developer community spanning China, the United States, Brazil, India, Japan, and beyond.

TRAE has grown into three major products:

- **TRAE Plugin.** An AI-powered extension for existing IDEs.
- **TRAE IDE.** A full-featured AI-native development environment.
- **TRAE SOLO.** A highly automated coding agent capable of handling the full software development lifecycle.

With over 100 feature updates shipped in a year and the #1 ranking on SWE-bench Verified, TRAE showcases how AI coding enables faster product iteration and continuous delivery at scale.

## What you can do with the Supabase integration

TRAE SOLO integrates deeply with Supabase, enabling developers to combine AI-driven coding workflows with Supabase's backend services. Once you authenticate with Supabase and assign a Supabase project to your TRAE project, you get full visibility into your backend directly from the IDE.

### Browse and query your database

View your database tables, explore schemas, and run queries without switching to the Supabase dashboard. The AI agent understands your database structure and can help you write queries, create migrations, and optimize your schema.

### Manage storage buckets

Browse your Supabase Storage buckets directly from TRAE. Upload, organize, and manage files as part of your development workflow.

### Configure authentication

View your auth settings and see your current users. The integration gives you visibility into your authentication configuration so you can develop auth flows with confidence.

### Manage your entire Supabase backend

TRAE also includes separate areas to manage other functions within Supabase, including:

- **Manage Secrets**. Securely manage your environment variables and secrets from within the IDE. Keep sensitive configuration in sync with your Supabase project.
- **Logs**. View your Supabase logs to debug issues and monitor your application. The integration surfaces relevant logs contextually as you develop.
- **AI Advisor**. TRAE's AI agent leverages your Supabase project context to provide smarter suggestions. It understands your database schema, auth configuration, and storage setup to generate more accurate code.

## TRAE also supports the Supabase MCP Server

Developers who want to perform tasks on their local or remote Supabase project can configure TRAE to use the Supabase MCP Server. This will give them access to all tools, including the ability to create databases, change RLS policies, add storage buckets, and much more.

## How it works

Getting started with Supabase in TRAE SOLO is straightforward:

1. **Authenticate with Supabase.** Connect your Supabase account to TRAE SOLO.
2. **Assign a project.** Select which Supabase project to associate with your TRAE project.
3. **Start building.** Access your database, storage, auth, and more directly from the IDE.

TRAE uses the [Supabase Management API](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/api/introduction) as well as the [Supabase MCP Server](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/mcp).

## From idea to deployment with SOLO Builder

TRAE SOLO represents a new way of building software. SOLO Builder helps developers move seamlessly from idea to product deployment, covering the complete software development lifecycle:

- **Product requirements.** Generate requirements from your ideas.
- **Environment configuration.** Set up your development environment automatically.
- **Code generation.** Build features with AI assistance.
- **Debugging.** Identify and fix issues efficiently.
- **Iterative development.** Refine and improve continuously.
- **Deployment.** Ship to production with confidence.

With Supabase integration, each of these stages benefits from direct access to your backend infrastructure.
