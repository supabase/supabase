This week we [launched Supabase Storage](/blog/supabase-storage), which leaves one other huge piece of the
stack that everyone is asking for: Functions.

## TLDR

We're not releasing Functions today. Trust us, we know you want them. They are coming, just not today.

But we are building something that we think you're going to like: Workflows. We haven't finished building it yet, but Workflows are
a "piece" of the Function story and arguably an even more exciting feature.

## Firebase Functions

Firebase functions are relatively simple. If you use Serverless, AWS Lambda, Cloudflare Workers, Next.js API routes, or
Netlify Functions, then you know how they work. A Firebase function executes some code which you provide, without you managing a server.

Specifically for Firebase, they have another key feature - they can be triggered by database events. For example, you can
trigger a function whenever a Firestore Document is updated.

This is great, but it is still limited for a few real-world use cases. For example, what if you want to send an email to a user
one day after a user signs up. Or one year? There is no queuing functionality in Firebase. You'd have to manage a process like
this yourself, probably using a cron-job.

## A better solution?

We searched for some open source tools which we think are solving this problem well. We looked at
[NodeRed](/blog/supabase-storage#designing-the-storage-middleware), [n8n](https://n8n.io/),
[Airflow](http://airflow.apache.org/blog/airflow-two-point-oh-is-here/), and about 10 other tools. They are amazing tools on their
own, but for the Supabase Stack they ultimately had the
[same shortcomings](/blog/supabase-storage#integration-with-the-supabase-ecosystem) that we found
with Storage providers - most of them lacked deep Postgres integration.

We went back to the drawing board and asked, "if we could wave a wand and get the perfect solution, what would it look like?".
The tool that came very close is [AWS Step Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/). The only problem: it's not open source.
Luckily, their [state language](https://states-language.net/spec.html) is.

Using this states language, we are [building an open source orchestration engine](https://github.com/supabase/workflows) for
managing very complex Workflows with queueing, etc. It will be built with Elixir.

This engine won't execute code. Instead, it will coordinate and execute existing functions wherever they live: AWS, GCP, Azure,
OpenFaas, and of course Postgres.

We plan to add "modules" which work natively: email services, notification services, and other platforms.

The engine is deeply integrated with Postgres. `Jobs`, `queues`, and `logs` will be stored and accessible by SQL. We'd like to give a shoutout to the [Oban](https://getoban.pro) team here, their robust job processing was a big missing piece for the engine. And most importantly, it's backed by Postgres!

Once ready, we will make this available in the Supabase Dashboard with a Zapier-like interface.

## What are Workflows

Workflows orchestrate and execute functions in response to a database event (insert, update, delete) or a HTTP call (direct invocation).

You can use them to rapidly develop microservices (once we have functions) without worrying about servers.

Workflows are stateless - the output of a state becomes the input of the next state.

Workflows are defined using Amazon States Languages, so you can import your workflows from AWS (although we are still building handlers
for most AWS resources).

Workflows can be _persistent_ (the default). This means they are tolerant to server restarts, but it also means they need to use
the database to store their state.

Workers can be _transient._ These are fully in-memory if you don't want to store the execution state (for example, IoT
applications that trigger workflows very often). Transient workflows are not restarted if the server crashes or is restarted.

## Example

A typical use-case for workflows is sending emails. For example, you might want to send a user an email one day after they
sign up. In database terms we can say: "trigger an email workflow whenever there is an insert on the `users` table."

Let's break this down into steps, then tie it all together at the end:

### Sending an email

```yaml
SendEmail:
  Type: Task
  Next: Complete
  Resource: my-email-service
  Parameters:
    api_key: my-api-key
    template_id: welcome-email
    payload:
      name.$: '$.record.name'
      email.$: '$.record.email'
```

Here we have a "Task" which triggers a call to an email service (like Mailgun or Postmark). Specifically, it's telling
the service to send the `welcome-email` template, and it's providing it a `name` and an `email` as parameters.

### Waiting a day

Since we don't want to send the email immediately, we need to tell Workflows to wait one day

```yaml
WaitOneDay:
  Type: Wait
  Next: SendEmail
  Seconds: 86400
```

Here "one day" is specified in seconds.

### Trigger on insert

We mentioned that you could trigger a workflow whenever there is an "insert" on the `users` table. But what if you insert
multiple users at once? Not a problem - we can loop through all the inserts with a `Map`:

```yaml
EmailUsers:
  Type: Map
  End: true
  InputPath: '$.changes'
  Iterator:
    StartAt: CheckInsert
    States:
      CheckInsert:
        Type: Choice
        Default: Complete
        Choices:
          - Variable: '$.type'
            StringEquals: INSERT
            Next: WaitOneDay
```

In this part, we have a task "EmailUsers", which iterates through all the database events (`$.changes`) and checks if they are INSERTs.

### Tying it all together

Let's see how it looks all together:

```yaml
---
Comment: Email users after one day
StartAt: EmailUsers
States:
  EmailUsers:
    Type: Map
    End: true
    InputPath: '$.changes'
    Iterator:
      StartAt: CheckInsert
      States:
        CheckInsert:
          Type: Choice
          Default: Complete
          Choices:
            - Variable: '$.type'
              StringEquals: INSERT
              Next: WaitOneDay
        WaitOneDay:
          Type: Wait
          Next: SendEmail
          Seconds: 86400
        SendEmail:
          Type: Task
          Next: Complete
          Resource: send-templated-email
          Parameters:
            api_key: my-api-key
            template_id: welcome-email
            payload:
              name.$: '$.record.name'
              email.$: '$.record.email'
        Complete:
          Type: Succeed
```

The workflow receives the following JSON data from Supabase [Realtime](https://github.com/supabase/realtime):

```json
{
  "changes": [
    {
      "columns": [
        {
          "flags": ["key"],
          "name": "id",
          "type": "int8",
          "type_modifier": 4294967295
        },
        {
          "flags": [],
          "name": "name",
          "type": "text",
          "type_modifier": 4294967295
        },
        {
          "flags": [],
          "name": "email",
          "type": "text",
          "type_modifier": 4294967295
        }
      ],
      "commit_timestamp": "2021-03-17T14:00:26Z",
      "record": {
        "id": "101492",
        "name": "Alfred",
        "email": "alfred@example.org"
      },
      "schema": "public",
      "table": "users",
      "type": "INSERT"
    }
  ],
  "commit_timestamp": "2021-03-17T14:00:26Z"
}
```

## Next Steps

We've already open sourced the Workflow interpreter [here](https://github.com/supabase/workflows). It's built with Elixir,
so you can find it on Hex [here](https://hexdocs.pm/workflows/Workflows.html).

After we've ironed out a few bugs we will integrate it into the Supabase Stack. As with all Supabase features, we'll add a
[nice UI](https://ui.supabase.com/) to make prototyping extremely rapid. We'll integrate the UI with the code (via Git) to make
sure everything is version controlled.
