/**
 * Required setup adapted from https://github.com/radix-ui/primitives/issues/856#issuecomment-928704064
 *
 * Implements a custom PointerEvent that can then be used to trigger the radix dropdown.
 * This is required as JSdom has not implemented the PointerEvent (see https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library/issues/838#issuecomment-735259406)
 *
 * Furthermore, ResizeObserver and DomRect are both not available in JSdom (see https://github.com/radix-ui/primitives/issues/856)
 *
 * Effects of this setup file:
 * - sets PointerEvent to window
 * - sets ResizeObserver to window
 * - sets DOMRect to window
 *
 * Needed to interact with dropdown components, with the `clickDropdown` helper.
