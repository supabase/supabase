// I don't think this is an ideal set up as the mock data is not clear in this file itself
// But this is the method that worked for me after hours of wrangling with jest.spyOn and jest.mock
// which for some reason none of them worked when I was trying to mock the data within the file itself
// I'd be keen to see how we can do this better if anyone is more familiar to jest 🙏
