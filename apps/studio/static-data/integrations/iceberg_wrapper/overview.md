Apache Iceberg is an open table format for huge analytic datasets. It makes it possible to handle large amounts of data using SQL queries with features like schema evolution, hidden partitioning, time travel, and version rollback.

The Iceberg Wrapper is a foreign data wrapper that allows you to query data from Apache Iceberg tables directly within your Postgres database. This integration enables you to query Iceberg tables using standard SQL.

By connecting Iceberg to your Supabase project, you can combine the power of Postgres with Iceberg's capabilities for managing large-scale analytical workloads.
