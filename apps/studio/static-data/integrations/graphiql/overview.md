GraphiQL is the GraphQL integrated development environment (IDE). It’s a powerful (and all-around awesome) tool you’ll use often while building Gatsby websites. It offers syntax highlighting, intellisense autocompletion, automatic documentation, and much more.

Use GraphiQL to interactively build your page and static queries.
