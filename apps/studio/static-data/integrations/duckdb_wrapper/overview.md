DuckDB is an open-source column-oriented Relational Database Management System. Unlike traditional databases that require a separate server process, DuckDB runs inside your database and works directly on data in memory or on disk, making it ideal for embedded analytics, data science workflows, and interactive analysis. It supports standard SQL syntax and can query data from multiple formats like CSV, Parquet, and even Pandas DataFrames or Arrow tables without needing to import them into a separate database.

Its architecture is optimized for analytical (OLAP) workloads rather than transactional (OLTP) ones. DuckDB uses a columnar storage format and vectorized execution engine, which allows it to perform complex aggregations and scans efficiently. Thanks to its lightweight nature and minimal setup, it's widely adopted in environments like Python, R, or even browser-based tools, serving as a powerful alternative to tools like SQLite for analytics tasks.
