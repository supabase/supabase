Let me consult the docs for the latest instructions.

Plan â€” what I'll do:
- Pull advisor findings to surface any warnings.
- Review recent error logs for failing components.

Findings:
- Advisors highlight security gaps and slow queries. Address materialized views in API schema, harden api.health_check, and profile the slow edge_function_logs query.
- Logs show edge-function invocation failures and RLS permission issues refreshing user_documents. Verify secrets/retry logic and ensure appropriate policies or service role context.`,
