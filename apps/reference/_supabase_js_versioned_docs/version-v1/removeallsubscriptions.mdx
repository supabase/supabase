import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs'
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem'

Closes and removes all subscriptions and returns a list of removed
subscriptions and their errors.

```js
supabase.removeAllSubscriptions()
```

## Notes

- Removing subscriptions is a great way to maintain the performance of your project's database. Supabase will automatically handle cleanup 30 seconds after a user is disconnected, but unused subscriptions may cause degradation as more users are simultaneously subscribed.

## Examples

### Removes all subscriptions

```js
supabase.removeAllSubscriptions()
```
