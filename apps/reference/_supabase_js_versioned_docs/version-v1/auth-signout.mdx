Inside a browser context, `signOut()` will remove the logged in user from the browser session
and log them out - removing all items from localstorage and then trigger a "SIGNED_OUT" event.

For server-side management, you can revoke all refresh tokens for a user by passing a user's JWT through to `auth.api.signOut(JWT: string)`. There is no way to revoke a user's session JWT before it automatically expires

```js
const { error } = await supabase.auth.signOut()
```

## Examples

### Sign out

```js
const { error } = await supabase.auth.signOut()
```
