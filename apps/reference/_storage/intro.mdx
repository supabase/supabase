# Supabase Storage Server

An S3 compatible object storage service that integrates with Postgres.

- Uses Postgres as it's datastore for storing metadata
- Authorization rules are written as Postgres Row Level Security policies
- Integrates with S3 as the storage backend (with more in the pipeline!)
- Extremely lightweight and performant
