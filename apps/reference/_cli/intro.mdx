# Supabase CLI

The Supabase CLI can be found in our [CLI](https://github.com/supabase/cli) repository.

The CLI is still under heavy development, but it will contain all the functionality for working with Supabase projects and the Supabase platform.

- Running Supabase locally: [`supabase start`](usage#supabase-start)
- Managing database migrations: [`supabase migration`](usage#supabase-migration)
- CI / CD for releasing to production: [`supabase db push`](usage#supabase-db-push)
- Manage your Supabase Projects: [`supabase projects`](usage#supabase-projects)
- Generating types directly from your database schema: [`supabase gen types`](usage#supabase-gen)
