# Supabase CLI

The Supabase CLI can be found in our [CLI](https://github.com/supabase/cli) repository.

The CLI is still under heavy development, but it will contain all the functionality for working with Supabase projects and the Supabase platform.

- Running Supabase locally: [`supabase start`](./cli/usage#supabase-start)
- Managing database migrations: [`supabase migration`](./cli/usage#supabase-migration)
- Pushing your local changes to production: [`supabase commit`](./cli/usage#supabase-db-remote-commit)
- Manage your Supabase Projects: [`supabase projects`](./cli/usage#supabase-projects)
- Generating types directly from your database schema: [`supabase gen types`](./cli/usage#supabase-gen)
