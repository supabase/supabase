Removes an active subscription and returns the number of open connections.

```dart
supabase.removeSubscription(mySubscription);
```

## Notes

- Removing subscriptions is a great way to maintain the performance of your project's database. Supabase will automatically handle cleanup 30 seconds after a user is disconnected, but unused subscriptions may cause degradation as more users are simultaneously subscribed.

## Examples

### Remove a subscription

```dart
supabase.removeSubscription(mySubscription);
```
