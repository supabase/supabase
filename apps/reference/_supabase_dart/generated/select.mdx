Performs vertical filtering with SELECT.

```dart
final res = await supabase
  .from('cities')
  .select()
  .execute();

final data = res.data;
final error = res.error;
```

## Notes

- By default, Supabase projects will return a maximum of 1,000 rows. This setting can be changed in Project API Settings. It's recommended that you keep it low to limit the payload size of accidental or malicious requests. You can use `range()` queries to paginate through your data.
- `select()` can be combined with [Modifiers](/docs/reference/dart/using-modifiers)
- `select()` can be combined with [Filters](/docs/reference/dart/using-filters)
- If using the Supabase hosted platform `apikey` is technically a reserved keyword, since the API gateway will pluck it out for authentication. [It should be avoided as a column name](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/issues/5465).

## Examples

### Getting your data

```dart
final res = await supabase
  .from('cities')
  .select()
  .execute();

final data = res.data;
final error = res.error;
```

### Selecting specific columns

You can select specific fields from your tables.

```dart
final res = await supabase
  .from('cities')
  .select('name')
  .execute();
```

### Query foreign tables

If your database has relationships, you can query related tables too.

```dart
final res = await supabase
  .from('countries')
  .select('''
    name,
    cities (
      name
    )
  ''')
  .execute();
```

### Query the same foreign table multiple times

Sometimes you will need to query the same foreign table twice.
In this case, you can use the name of the joined column to identify
which join you intend to use. For convenience, you can also give an
alias for each column. For example, if we had a shop of products,
and we wanted to get the supplier and the purchaser at the same time
(both in the users) table:

```dart
final res = await supabase
  .from('products')
  .select('''
    id,
    supplier:supplier_id ( name ),
    purchaser:purchaser_id ( name )
  ''')
  .execute();
```

### Filtering with inner joins

If you want to filter a table based on a child table's values you can use the `!inner()` function. For example, if you wanted
to select all rows in a `message` table which belong to a user with the `username` "Jane":

```dart
final res = await supabase
  .from('messages')
  .select('*, users!inner(*)')
  .eq('users.username', 'Jane')
  .execute();
```

### Querying with count option

You can get the number of rows by using the count option.
Allowed values for count option are [exact](https://postgrest.org/en/stable/api.html#exact-count), [planned](https://postgrest.org/en/stable/api.html#planned-count) and [estimated](https://postgrest.org/en/stable/api.html#estimated-count).

```dart
final res = await supabase
    .from('cities')
    .select('name')
    .execute(count: CountOption.exact);

final count = res.count;
```

### Querying JSON data

If you have data inside of a JSONB column, you can apply select
and query filters to the data values. Postgres offers a
[number of operators](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html)
for querying JSON data. Also see
[PostgREST docs](http://postgrest.org/en/v7.0.0/api.html#json-columns) for more details.

```dart
final res = await supabase
  .from('users')
  .select('''
    id, name,
    address->street
  ''')
  .eq('address->postcode', 90210)
  .execute();
```

### Return data as CSV

By default the data is returned in JSON format, however you can also request for it to be returned as Comma Separated Values.

```dart
final res = await supabase
  .from('users')
  .select()
  .csv()
  .execute();
```
