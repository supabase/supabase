## Dart

Dart libraries are built and supported by the community.

```bash
dart pub add supabase
```

Find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-dart).

## Flutter

For Flutter project, you can use [supabase_flutter](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-flutter).

```bash
flutter pub add supabase_flutter
```

`supabase_flutter` plugin uses `supabase` plugin internally, and it adds some Flutter specific functionality such as handling deeplinks coming back from magic link verifications.
If you are creating a Flutter application, we recommend using `supabase_flutter` instead of `supabase`.

For the most part `supabase_flutter` shares the same API as `supabase` with few exceptions such as initialization or OAuth sign in.
