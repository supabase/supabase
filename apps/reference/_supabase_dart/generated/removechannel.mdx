Unsubscribes and removes Realtime channel from Realtime client.

```dart
final status = await supabase.removeChannel(channel);
```

## Notes

- Removing a channel is a great way to maintain the performance of your project's Realtime service as well as your database if you're listening to Postgres changes. Supabase will automatically handle cleanup 30 seconds after a client is disconnected, but unused channels may cause degradation as more clients are simultaneously subscribed.

## Examples

### Remove a channel

```dart
final status = await supabase.removeChannel(channel);
