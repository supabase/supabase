Log in an existing user, or login via a third-party provider.

```dart
final res = await supabase.auth.signIn(email: 'example@email.com', password: 'example-password');

final user = res.data?.user;
final error = res.error;
```

## Notes

- A user can sign up via email, phone number.
- If you provide `email` without a `password`, the user will be sent a magic link.
- The magic link's destination URL is determined by the SITE_URL config variable. To change this, you can go to Authentication -> Settings on [app.supabase.com](https://app.supabase.com)
- Similarly, if you provide `phone` without a `password`, the user will be sent a one time password.
- If you are looking to sign users in with OAuth in Flutter apps, go to [`signInWithProvider()`](/docs/reference/dart/auth-signinwithprovider).

## Examples

### Sign in with email.

```dart
final res = await supabase.auth.signIn(email: 'example@email.com', password: 'example-password');

final user = res.data?.user;
final error = res.error;
```

### Sign in with magic link.

If email is provided, but no password is provided, the user will be sent a "magic link" to their email address, which they can click to open your application with a valid session. By default, a given user can only request a Magic Link once every 60 seconds.

```dart
final res = await supabase.auth.signIn(email: 'example@email.com');

final error = res.error;
```

### Get OAuth sign in URL.

Passing provider parameter to `signIn()` will return a URL to sign your user in via OAuth.
If you are looking to sign in a user via OAuth on Flutter app, go to [`signInWithProvider()`](/docs/reference/dart/auth-signinwithprovider).

```dart
final res = await supabase.auth.signIn(provider: Provider.github);

final url = res.data?.url;
final error = res.error;
```
