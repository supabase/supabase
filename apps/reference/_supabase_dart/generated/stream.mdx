Notifies of data at the queried table.

```dart
supabase
  .from('countries')
  .stream(['id'])
  .execute();
```

## Notes

- `stream()` will emit the initial data as well as any further change on the database as `Stream` of `List<Map<String, dynamic>>` by combining Postgrest and Realtime.
- Takes a list of primary key columns as its argument.

## Examples

### Listening to a specific table

```dart
supabase
  .from('countries')
  .stream(['id'])
  .execute();
```

### Listening to a specific rows within a table

You can listen to individual rows using the format `{table}:{col}=eq.{val}` - where `{col}` is the column name, and `{val}` is the value which you want to match.
This syntax is the as how you can filter data in Realtime

```dart
supabase
  .from('countries:id=eq.120')
  .stream(['id'])
  .execute();
```

### With `order()`

```dart
supabase
  .from('countries')
  .stream(['id'])
  .order('name', ascending: false)
  .execute();
```

### With `limit()`

```dart
supabase
  .from('countries')
  .stream(['id'])
  .order('name', ascending: false)
  .limit(10)
  .execute();
```
