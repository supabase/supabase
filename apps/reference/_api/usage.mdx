## New user signup

const { user, session, error } = await gotrue.signUp({
  email: 'example@email.com',
  password: 'example-password',
})
```


### Attributes


- param-signup-options

- param-options



### Notes

- By default, the user will need to verify their email address before logging in. If you would like to change this, you can disable "Email Confirmations" by going to Authentication -> Settings on [app.supabase.com](https://app.supabase.com)
- If "Email Confirmations" is turned on, a `user` is returned but `session` will be null
- If "Email Confirmations" is turned off, both a `user` and a `session` will be returned
- When the user confirms their email address, they will be redirected to localhost:3000 by default. To change this, you can go to Authentication -> Settings on [app.supabase.com](https://app.supabase.com)
- If signUp() is called for an existing confirmed user:
    - If "Enable email confirmations" is enabled on the "Authentication" -> "Settings" page, an obfuscated / fake user object will be returned.
    - If "Enable email confirmations" is disabled, an error with a message "User already registered" will be returned.
- To check if a user already exists, refer to getUser().


### Examples



#### Sign up with email

```js
const { user, session, error } = await supabase.auth.signUp({
  email: 'example@email.com',
  password: 'example-password',
})
```
