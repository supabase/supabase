# Supabase Auth Server

The Supabase Auth Server (GoTrue) is a JWT based API for managing users and issuing JWT tokens.

GoTrue is a small open-source API written in golang, that can act as a self-standing API service for handling user registration and authentication for JAM projects.

It's based on OAuth2 and JWT and will handle user signup, authentication and custom user data.
