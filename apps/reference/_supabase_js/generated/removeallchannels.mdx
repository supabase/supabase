Unsubscribes and removes all Realtime channels from Realtime client.

```js
supabase.removeAllChannels()
```

## Notes

- Removing channels is a great way to maintain the performance of your project's Realtime service as well as your database if you're listening to Postgres changes. Supabase will automatically handle cleanup 30 seconds after a client is disconnected, but unused channels may cause degradation as more clients are simultaneously subscribed.

## Examples

### Removes all channels

```js
supabase.removeAllChannels()
```
