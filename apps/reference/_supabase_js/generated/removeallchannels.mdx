Unsubscribes and removes all Realtime channels from Realtime client.

```js
supabase.removeAllChannels()
```

## Notes

- Removing subscriptions is a great way to maintain the performance of your project's database. Supabase will automatically handle cleanup 30 seconds after a user is disconnected, but unused subscriptions may cause degradation as more users are simultaneously subscribed.

## Examples

### Removes all subscriptions

```js
supabase.removeAllChannels()
```
