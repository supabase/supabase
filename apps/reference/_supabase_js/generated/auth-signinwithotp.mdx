## Notes

- This method is used for passwordless sign-ins where an otp is sent to the user's email or phone number.
- Requires either an email or phone number.
- If you're using an email, you can configure whether you want the user to receive a magiclink or an otp.
- If you're using phone, you can configure whether you want the user to receive a magiclink or an otp.
- The magic link's destination URL is determined by the SITE_URL config variable. To change this, you can go to Authentication -> Settings on [app.supabase.com](https://app.supabase.com)
