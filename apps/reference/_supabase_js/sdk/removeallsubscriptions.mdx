import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

Closes and removes all subscriptions and returns a list of removed
subscriptions and their errors.

```js
supabase.removeAllSubscriptions()
```






## Notes

- Removing subscriptions is a great way to maintain the performance of your project's database. Supabase will automatically handle cleanup 30 seconds after a user is disconnected, but unused subscriptions may cause degradation as more users are simultaneously subscribed.










## Examples

### Removes all subscriptions



```js
supabase.removeAllSubscriptions()
```
