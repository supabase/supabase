Inside a browser context, `user()` will return the user data, if there is a logged in user.

For server-side management, you can get a user through `auth.api.getUserByCookie()`

```js
const user = supabase.auth.user()
```

## Notes

This method gets the user object from memory.

## Examples

### Get the logged in user

```js
const user = supabase.auth.user()
```
