title: Service Level Agreement
---

The following Service Level Agreement, which is incorporated into and forms part of the Subscription Agreement between Supabase, Inc. ("Supabase") and Customer (the "Agreement"), will apply to the Services for Enterprise Customers specified in an Order Form during the applicable Subscription Term:

## Platform

### 1. Uptime Commitment

Supabase will provide Actual Availability for at least ninety-nine and nine tenths percent (99.9%) of the total time in each calendar month during the Subscription Term, as measured by Supabase (the **"Uptime Commitment"**).

### 2. Service Credits

If the Uptime Commitment is not met during any particular calendar month during the Subscription Term, then Customer will be eligible for a service credit ("Service Credit"), provided that Customer reports to Supabase such failure to meet the Uptime Commitment and requests such Service Credit in accordance with this Exhibit. The amount of any Service Credit due hereunder shall be calculated as follows:
X \* Y, where X = the total fees due from Customer to Supabase for the affected Services for the relevant calendar month (regardless of when billed or payable), and Y = the Credit Percentage corresponding with the Actual Availability provided (as a percentage of total time) for the relevant calendar month, as set forth in the table below.

| Actual Availability                                | Credit Percentage |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Less than 99.9% but greater than or equal to 99.0% | 10%               |
| Less than 99.0% but greater than or equal to 98.0% | 15%               |
| Less than 98.0% but greater than or equal to 96.0% | 20%               |
| Less than 96.0%                                    | 30%               |

### 3. Credit Requests and Payment

To request a Service Credit, Customer must send an email to Supabase at support@supabase.io within thirty (30) days of the end of the month in which the Uptime Commitment was not met. Customer must include either its account ID or registered email address, and the previously reported dates and times that there was no Service Availability. If Supabase confirms that Customer is eligible for a Service Credit, Supabase will issue a credit to Customer’s account within thirty (30) days. Service Credits are not refunds, cannot be exchanged into a cash amount, and may only be used against future billing charges. Except as set forth in Section 4 below, the Service Credits shall be Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy, and Supabase’s sole and exclusive liability, for any failure by Supabase to meet the Uptime Commitment.

### 4. Definitions

All capitalized words used but not defined in this Service Level Agreement have the meaning set forth in the Agreement.
