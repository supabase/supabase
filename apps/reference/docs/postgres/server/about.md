title: Postgres
description: 'The easiest way to get started with Postgres.'
---

We've talked to a lot of developers, and they often tell us that they know Postgres is the best database for their needs, but they still choose something that's easier to get started.

We want to solve that problem. So we packaged Postgres with some useful plugins and built some one-click installers. Our goal is not to modify Postgres, but to provide some of the most common extensions with a simple installation process.
