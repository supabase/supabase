The Supabase Marketplace brings together all the tools you need to extend your Supabase project. This includes:

- [Experts](https://supabase.com/partners/experts): Partners to help you build and support your Supabase project.
- [Integrations](https://supabase.com/partners/integrations): Extend your projects with external Auth, Caching, Hosting, and Low Code tools.

## Building an integration

Supabase provides several integration points:

- The [Postgres connection](/docs/guides/database/connecting-to-postgres). Anything that works with Postgres will also work with Supabase projects.
- The [Project REST API](/docs/guides/api#rest-api) & Client libs.
- The [Project GraphQL API](/docs/guides/api#graphql-api).
- The [Platform API](/docs/reference/api).

### Listing your integration

You can list your integration in our Partners marketplace and inside the Supabase Docs by [applying](https://supabase.com/partners/integrations#become-a-partner) through our Partners program.

Integrations will be assessed on the following criteria:

- **Business viability**:<br />while we welcome everyone to built an integration, we will only list companies that are deemed to be long-term viable. This includes an official business registration and bank account, meaningful revenue, or VC backing. We require this criteria to ensure the health of the marketplace.
- **Compliance**:<br />Integrations should not infringe on Supabase brand/trademark. In short, you cannot use "Supabase" in the name. Because the listing will appear on the Supabase domain, we don't want to mislead developers into thinking that an integration is an official product.
- **Sevice Level Agreements**:<br />All listings are required to have their own Terms and Conditions, Privacy Policy, and Acceptable Use Policy, and the company must have resources to meet their SLAs.
- **Maintainability**:<br />All integrations are required to be maintained and functional with Supabase, and the company may be assessed on your ability to remain functional over a long time horizon.
