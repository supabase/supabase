This guide explains how to quickly connect Supabase back-end to an DhiWise Flutter application.

[DhiWise](https://www.dhiwise.com/) is a Developer tools to covert Figma designs into React and Flutter applications. It let's you integrate Database and APIs to your React and Flutter Apps quickly.

If you don’t have an DhiWise account, create one [here](https://app.dhiwise.com).

DhiWise supports easy Supabase integration in just 5 steps.

Let’s get started!

## Step 1: SignIn to Supabase

Go to [Supabase](https://supabase.com/), Click on `Sign In` and and create a new account by authenticating with **GitHub**. If you already have an account, you will be logged in.

## Step 2: Create a new project in Supabase

From the Dashboard click on `New project` and select an organization. If you don’t have an organization then create one using `+ New organization`

- Give your Supabase project a `name`.
- Enter a secure `Database Password`.
- Choose the `region` where your app's backend is hosted.
- Click `Create new project`.

## step 3: Find the API key and URL

Once your project is created you can access the API Key and URL string, Or if you already have an account go to your `organization-> app-> settings-> API`.

## Step 4: Integrations

Now, There are two ways you can integrate Supabase into DhiWise Flutter Application.

### Authentication

You can integrate `Supabase Email/Password SignUp` or `Supabase Email/Password SignIn` on your components.

- Open the screen of your flutter application
- Go to component on which you want to add Authentication
- on the `onClick` method - select `authentication`
- From the list, If you want SignUp - select `SignUp with Email/Password` otherwise select `SignIn with Email/Password` from Supabase Auth section

And that's it. Supabase authentication will be added to the selected component.

After downloading the application source code,
1. Add Supabase URL and Supabase public key inside ***lib/core/utils/initial_bindings*** file.
2. For additional details refer ***https://supabase.com/docs/guides/with-flutter***

### Working with Data

When you are first time integrating Supabase in your DhiWise Flutter application, You will be asked to add [Supabase auth key and URL](##step-3-find-the-api-key-and-url). When you will add them, all the tables available in your Supabase project will be synced in DhiWise, and then you can integrate Select and Create queries on your Flutter screen for a particular table in DhiWise. 

<h3> Select records </h3>

#### **Step 1:** 
Select the screen from the screen list on which you want to integrate Supabase.

#### **Step 2:** 
Next, go to the view where you want to add Integration, and from the suggestion box for the `onClick` property, choose `Supabase integration`, which will take you to the Integration screen. Where you will be asked to `Enter function name`. Enter the name of your function and click `Submit`.

#### **Step 3:** 
After submitting the function name, you will be asked to select a type of Supabase integration. To retrieve data from Supabase, choose `select`.

#### **Step 4:** 
Next, select the table in from which you want to fetch records, from the listed Tables.

#### **Step 5:** 
Select type of integration

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Single**  | Used to fetch a single record from the database.  |
| **Multiple** | Used to fetch multiple records from the database. |

:::info
For Multiple type, you need to set `data limit`, `order by`, and `order`
:::

#### **Step 6:** 
Now, you will be redirected to API Integration screen, where you can set request, and response.

For request binding, below types are supported. Also, Select operator for comparison before moving forward.

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **View** | Select any component from your screen. |
| **Constant** | Select a constant you've created in your app. |
| **Get from preference** | Select they key you want to fetch from preference. |
| **Navigation argument** | Select data that's been passed from one screen to another. |

For response binding, below types are supported.

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |

| **Save to preference** | Storing the data to preference. |

#### **Select 7:** 
`Handle action` - Select the action you wish to take, once the Supabase call has either been accepted successfully or refused due to an error.

Available action for On success and On error are,

1. [Show Alert](https://docs.dhiwise.com/docs/flutter/show-alert)
2. [Navigation](https://docs.dhiwise.com/docs/flutter/navigation)

#### **Step 8:** 
Finally, you have added Supabase to your application to fetch records on your screen!

:::tip Example 
Suppose you want to fetch records from Supabase and populate the item list on your screen, Here you can integrate Supabase as discussed above and can bind the response with your list view.
:::

<h3> Create records </h3>

#### **Step 1:** 
Choose the screen you wish to integrate Supabase for, from the list of screens.

#### **Step 2:** 
Next, switch to the component you want to add Integration, and on the `onClick` property, choose `Supabase integration`, which will take you to its integration screen, where you will be asked to **Enter function name** which will be used in generated code. Enter the name for it and click `Submit`.

#### **Step 3:** 
After submitting the function name, you will be asked to select a type of Supabase integration. To create a record in Supabase, choose to `Create`.

#### **Step 4:** 
Next, select the table in which you want to create a record, from the listed Tables.

#### **Step 5:** 
If you want to create a Single record, Select **Select**, otherwise **Multiple**.

#### **Step 6:** 
Now, you will be redirected to API Integration screen, where you can set request, and response.
