Allowing you to build secure applications with Supabase is our priority. This guide sheds some light on the measures we take to secure
Supabase Auth and provides some guidance on building secure applications.

:::note
To report a security vulnerability with Supabase Auth or any
other Supabase service, email [security@supabase.com](mailto:security@supabase.com). Review the
[security.txt](https://supabase.com/.well-known/security.txt) policy for a list of vulnerabilities that are not in scope.
:::

## Credentials

Credentials such as email addresses, phone numbers, passwords, and one-time
passwords are always sent to Supabase Auth as `POST` requests over TLS. This
prevents them from being accidentally logged in HTTP request logs as part of
the URL.

An exception to this rule is magic links, which encode a short-lived,
difficult-to-guess code in a URL. This URL sends a `GET` request to
Supabase Auth and the code can only be used once.

Passwords are stored in your project's database hashed with the
[bcrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt) password hashing function at a
difficulty level of 10.

Unlike other authentication services, Supabase Auth stores each
project's user information in isolated Postgres databases. This means that
security incidents involving other projects will not result in an incident in
your project.

Social login (e.g., Login with GitHub) often uses the OAuth authorization
protocol. Supabase Auth does not store the token issued by the provider, but
does make it available to your browser's app should you need further access to
it. Each subsequent sign-in with OAuth updates the user's identifying
information in Supabase Auth.

### Automatic linking

Users with the same email address in different social login providers will get
one single user account in Supabase Auth. We believe this to be the most common
expected behavior for modern applications.

:::warning
**Not all social login providers can be trusted!** Some providers will allow
social login with your application **even if the user's email address is not
confirmed.** This has the unintended side-effect that attackers could abuse
such a social login provider to gain access to a legitimate user's account.
**Always make sure you verify the behavior of social login providers with
regards to confirming the user's email address!**
:::

### Magic links

Supabase Auth provides passwordless sign-in with magic links. Magic links are a
URL that contains a single-use and unguessable code. By default this URL is
hosted by the Supabase Auth server and immediately redirects back to your app.

You should be aware that email messages are inherently insecure, although the
default SMTP settings from Supabase Auth always attempt to deliver email
messages via TLS to the receiving server.

There are a number of email clients, enterprise and end-user security software,
which inspect email messages for malware. Often this software will visit links
in messages (sometimes multiple times) in an attempt to scan for viruses.
Unfortunately this has the effect of signing up a user without their knowledge
or express consent. Furthermore, it does give out an access and refresh token
to this software which could be used maliciously.

:::warning
We do not recommend using magic-link sign in without customization for
applications requiring a high level of authentication security. Should you wish
to still use magic-links you can prevent this type of issues by modifying the
magic link email template to point to your application where you can present
the user with a button that will lead to the magic link URL.
:::

## User information

Supabase Auth stores user account information in your project's database. This
information is provided by your application or collected from third-party
identity providers.

Email addresses, phone numbers and other personally identifiable information is
not stored encrypted in your project's database. If you need to store encrypted
data for users, we recommend you check out Supabase Vault as an easy and safe
way to achieve this.

### User enumeration protection

User enumeration is a technique where third-parties gather information about
the existence of accounts on a system. In and of itself the use of this
technique does not indicate malicious behavior, but it may be used as part of
such an effort.

Although [industry best
practices](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html#authentication-and-error-messages)
ask for applications to mask the existence of accounts in their system to
unauthorized parties, this is easier said than done, especially when dealing
with a system using email and password login. Below are some examples where
applications typically fail to mask the existence of an account.

1. **Side-channel leak via password hashing.**  
Even if an application returns ambiguous messages such as "Email or password
not correct." the login request will have a significantly longer duration if
the account exists. This is because password-hashing functions take hundreds of
milliseconds to compare a stored password hash with the provided and possibly
incorrect password. A typical solution to this problem is making all login
requests have an equal and long duration to obfuscate the fact. However, this
is only a half-way solution since attackers can intentionally overload a system
and still gather information from the side-channel.
2. **Side-channel leak via email or SMS.**  
With passwordless login or flows such as forgot password, information about
whether an account exists in the system can leak even if the application
returns an ambigouous message such as "If you have an account an email has been
sent." This is because the final part of the request handling will need to send
out an email message or SMS using a third-party system. This makes requests
naturally last longer when an account exists. Sometimes applications add
per-account rate-limiting to stop abuse, but this can exacerbate the problem as
rate-limiting counts toward accounts that exist, not those that do not. Thus
attackers can intentionally trigger rate-limits and gather information that
way.
3. **Account creation vs. login.**  
Often applications will obfuscate login requests, but not account creation
requests, thus leaking information and confusing legitimate users. Those on the
login flow will be told "Email or password is not correct." while on the
sign-up flow they will be outright told "An account with this email address
already exists." The problem compounds if the user has both social login and
password based login. In this situation there is no solution to the problem,
you can either: tell the user outright that there is already an account,
redirect to the social login provider (which again leaks the information), or
return a server error (that still leaks the information).

Large scale user enumeration attacks can be partially mitigated or made
inefficient by enabling some form of abuse protection for your project, such as
setting adequate per-IP rate limiting or a Turing test system like
CAPTCHA.

### Guarantees

As having a solution that covers all possible cases is virtually impossible,
Supabase Auth gives out these conditional guarantees on the user enumeration
problem.

We believe these guarantees strike the right balance between user experience,
system performance, privacy and security both for hobby and enterprise
projects.

**No guarantees.**

Supabase Auth is likely to leak information about the existence of any account
that has an associated password and the password is a viable login mechanism
for that account. To make it easier for users, Supabase Auth may directly communicate with users about the existence of their account or
correctness of their password.

Supabase Auth is also likely to leak information about the existence of any
account through a side-channel if email or phone passwordless
authentication is used. To make it easier for users, Supabase Auth
may directly communicate with users about the existence of their account, any
blocking measures, or rate-limiting applied to their account.

**Weak guarantees.**

Supabase Auth is not likely to divulge information about the existence of any
account in the system provided the account is accessible through one and only
one social login provider, and no other social login providers are enabled for
the project.

Any attempts to use multiple social login providers for an account, especially
ones that do not offer guarantees about the verification status of the email
address, may lead to leaking of information about the existence or blocking
measures applied to a user account.

**Stronger guarantees.**

Supabase Auth will not leak information about users with accounts accessible
through enterprise-level identity providers via the SAML or OIDC protocols,
provided that no account linking has taken place on those accounts with social
login providers or with password and passwordless authentication.

If your application has high privacy requirements, your
users should obfuscate their email address by using virtual email addresses (e.g., `user+obfuscation@example.com` if allowed by their email address
provider) or use a trusted social login provider.

## Access and refresh tokens

A successful user login triggers Supabase Auth to issue an access and refresh
token.

Access tokens are in the form of a JSON Web Token (JWT) and include most
standard JWT claims for this purpose. At this time each JWT is signed using the
`HS256` algorithm (HMAC with SHA256). The secret key used to derive the
signature is generated from a cryptographically-secure pseudo random number
generator when a project is initially created and is 512 bits long. This key is
stored encrypted in our database, so Supabase staff are unable to readily
access it.

We believe in giving project owners maximum flexibility, so this key is visible
to you only in your project's dashboard. Make sure you never share this value
with parties you don't completely trust.

:::tip
You can always rotate the JWT signing key if you suspect it has leaked.
Rotating keys on a regular basis is a good practice. Note that rotating a key
means that all access tokens will immediately become invalid. Make sure you do
not forget to update all other services that you use Supabase Auth access
tokens in with the rotated secret to avoid any disruptions.
:::

Access tokens are also short lived, and you can configure their validity
duration in the project's settings page. The default value at this time is 1
hour, which is common across the industry. We do not recommend exceeding this
duration period, and recommend using a shorter value if it makes sense for your
application. Durations less than 5 minutes are discouraged as computers often
may have significant clock skew that could introduce confusing and difficult to
debug application errors and behaviors. Shortening the duration also increases
the application's dependence of the uptime of the authentication server.

The purpose of access tokens is to be readily shared between components of your
application, be it the browser, Supabase services such as PostgREST and
functions, your hosting or other API servers under your control. Due to
their short lifetime, any security incident involving them will have a
time-limited blast radius.

Always make sure that access tokens are passed as headers or cookies, and avoid
passing them as URL query parameters (regardless of request methods) to prevent
them from appearing in access logs which may not be under your total control.
When using them in Supabase functions or other API servers, take care to not
accidentally write them to logs.

It is for this reason that Supabase Auth returns both the access token and
refresh token to your browser application via the URL fragment (anything after
the `#` sign), as browsers will actually avoid sending this data to the
underlying server. Thus this makes sure that the access and refresh token are
received only by the JavaScript running in your browser and does not end up in
access logs or is visible by your application's hosting service. Even if the
servers hosting your browser application are under your total control, we've
found that often there are various other appliances that intercept HTTP
requests where disabling logging is difficult or sometimes impossible.

Access tokens are not stored by Supabase Auth or other services, regardless if
they are valid or not. We also recommend that any Supabase functions or API
servers you use avoid storing access tokens they've seen.

:::tip
Sometimes it is necessary to record or identify if a server has seen an access
token (for complex rate limiting or other features). Should you find yourself
needing such functionality, a good approach is to record the JWT's signature
instead of the whole string or some derivative hash. The signature can be found
after the last period `.` in the JWT string. Always validate the JWT signature
before you record such values!
:::

If you use Supabase Auth in Android applications, though, there is a
non-negligible risk that other applications installed on the device may be able
to maliciously (or otherwise) intercept both the access and refresh tokens on
succesful sign in. This is because Android implements URL callbacks by invoking
all applications registered to listen to the URL. Thus, any application may
register to listen to URLs that you control, and there's not much you can do to
prevent this from occurring. The industry standard way to mitigate this risk is
to use a different exchange mechanism with Supabase Auth called PKCE (Proof Key
for Code Exchange). At this time Supabase Auth **does not implement PKCE** but
it is on our roadmap.

:::tip
Although Supabase Auth does not implement the PKCE mechanism which would
completely mitigate the issue where other applications may be listening in for
your user's access and refresh tokens, we recommend [adding funcionatlity in
your app that would periodically scan for other applications installed on the
device that claim to handle your application's
URLs](https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/package-visibility-in-android-11-cc857f221cd9).
Should you find one you can't recognize, indicate to the user prior sign in to
remove the offending application. 
:::

Refresh tokens are long-lived opaque strings that are issued by Supabase Auth
together with access tokens. They are named after their purpose: to refresh the
access token for the particular user session. A refresh token can usually be
used only once or a few times within a time period. Note that a refresh token
does not uniquely identify an authenticated user session on a particular
browser.

Because refresh tokens can generally be used only once you should not be
sharing them between different components of your application. For example,
they should not be sent to Supabase functions or other API servers.
Importantly, though, they can be shared with your hosting server but only to
support server-side rendering functionality of your app.

:::tip
Your browser based application can share the access and refresh token with your
hosting server by using cookies, instead of calling requests. Below is a
snippet of code you can use to instruct the Supabase client library to keep the
cookies up-to-date.

```typescript
supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange((event, session) => {
  if (event === "SIGNED_OUT" || event === "USER_DELETED") {
    // delete cookies on sign out
    const expires = new Date(0).toUTCString();
    document.cookie = `my-access-token=; path=/; expires=${expires}; SameSite=Lax; secure`;
    document.cookie = `my-refresh-token=; path=/; expires=${expires}; SameSite=Lax; secure`;
  } else if (event === "SIGNED_IN" || event === "TOKEN_REFRESHED") {
    const maxAge = 100 * 365 * 24 * 60 * 60; // 100 years, never expires
    document.cookie = `my-access-token=${session.access_token}; path=/; max-age=${maxAge}; SameSite=Lax; secure`;
    document.cookie = `my-refresh-token=${session.refresh_token}; path=/; max-age=${maxAge}; SameSite=Lax; secure`;
  }
})
```
:::

We've identified the following legitimate reasons that may cause a refresh
token to be used more than once in a short timespan:

1. **Serving a request from a web server that does server-side rendering.**  
   The access token sent by the browser to the server may have expired, but the
   user's session is still active. The server will then refresh the access token,
   which will invalidate the refresh token on the server side. Once the request is
   served to the browser, the Supabase client library will trigger another request
   to refresh the access token with the token that the server used. Usually the
   time difference between both refresh calls is less than 1 second, though may
   vary up to 10 seconds or more.
2. **Multi-tab synchronization issues.**  
   Should your browser based application be open in multiple browser tabs, your
   application's code may submit the same refresh token from each tab
   simultaneously. It is often too difficult to properly synchronize and
   coordinate data between multiple tabs. Fortunately though, simultaneus use of
   refresh tokens is rare and does not produce adverse effects in applications
   provided the refresh calls occur within the refresh token reuse period.
3. **Retry logic or bugs.**  
   Requests are known to fail for various reasons, and bugs can't be ruled out
   both in your application's code or the client libraries by Supabase. Thus retry
   behavior may trigger multiple refresh token validations in such cases.

:::tip
You can configure whether Supabase Auth allows the reuse of refresh tokens
multiple times and an appropriate reuse window for your application. If you
expect your app not to need the above listed legitimate reasons we recommend
using a very short reuse window no longer than 10 seconds.
:::

Refresh tokens are stored hashed with the SHA-256/224 hash function in your
project's database. Some older versions of Supabase Auth stored refresh tokens
in plaintext in the database. Plaintext tokens do not have the `H:` prefix. We
do this to prevent unauthorized parties from impersonating users, should the
contents of the database leak or be accidentally accessed.

Supabase does not store refresh tokens elsewhere.

:::tip
Sometimes it is necessary to record or identify if a server has seen a refresh
token (for complex rate limiting or other features). Should you find yourself
needing such functionality, a good approach is to store a hash of the refresh
token value. Since refresh tokens are generated with a cryptographically-secure
pseudo-random number generator they do not need to be hashed with a password
hashing function like Argon2, bcrypt or scrypt. We recommend using any of the
SHA-256 (especially the truncated version: SHA-256/224), SHA-512
(especially the truncated versions: SHA-512/256 or SHA-512/384), or any of
the SHA-3 functions.
:::

Refresh tokens are intentionally not bound to the browser with cookies, IP
addresses, cryptographic keys or other mechanisms as we believe these have only
marginal security benefits while introducing significant developer experience
challenges.

We also do not recommend using any additional obfuscation measures to store
access and refresh tokens in the browser, like encrypting values in the
browser's local or session storage, cookies or the indexed database. This
recommendation is based on our experience that such measures only marginally
contribute to the overall security while negatively impacting developer
experience.

We base our security recommendations on the assumption that the end-user's
devices are not compromised. This is because there is not much that can be done
to protect information stored in the browser when the end-user's operating
system or browser has been compromised. Attackers will be able to extract any
and all information.

:::tip
Although it is difficult to protect users when their device is compromised, it
is possible to implement some application-level security mechanisms to ensure
the authenticity and awareness of the user. For example, sensitive user actions
that may modify certain settings or grant access to protected data should be
gated with additional authentication layers, or send email notifications to
users when they occur.
:::

:::tip
There are some social engineering attacks that instruct users without a
technical background to access the browser's developer console in an effort to
extract access and refresh tokens. We recommend that your application emit
informational text with `console.log()` to inform users without a technical
background never to divulge information found in the console. [This text can be
styled with some CSS to make it
prominent.](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/console/api/#styling_console_output_with_css)
:::

## Abuse protection

Your Supabase Auth server uses industry standard denial of service and bot
protection, which is not configurable. However, this protection is there to
ensure reliability of Auth and other Supabase services and is not meant as a
general abuse protection.

Your project's Auth server does have built-in IP-based rate limiting. Do
note that IP-based rate limiting can often trigger false-positives. What may
appear to be a rate-limit breach, could actually mean legitimate users
attempting to use your app at the same time. We've commonly seen this in the
following scenarios:

1. **IPv4 with NAT.**  
There's a worldwide shortage of IPv4 addresses which forces internet service
providers to use a technique called NAT (Network Address Translation) to share
one IP address with many (sometimes thousands) end users.  
2. **Corporate users.**  
Corporations often route office internet traffic through one or more IPv4
addresses. If you are building an enterprise application this may be a common
occurence, for example if many employees sign in at once in common hours of the
day.
3. **Internet security software.**  
Some end-users use internet security software which routes or inspects internet
traffic via centralized servers before showing the content to the user.
Supabase Auth will then rate-limit based on the IP address of the server, and
can cause multiple users of the same software have a degraded experience.
4. **VPN.**  
Some end users use Virtual Private Networks to protect their internet
connection or to access content from other geographical locations. This means
that Supabase Auth could trigger rate-limit protection since many VPN users
share one IPv4 address.

Because of these common cases, rate-limit protection per IP address is quite
generous but is not effective at distributed attacks.

Supabase Auth does support using a [Turing
test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA) in the form of a CAPTCHA via the
[hCaptcha](https://www.hcaptcha.com) service to identify humans vs. robots. You
can enable this protection in your project's dashboard.

:::tip
The [W3C does not recommend the use of
CAPTCHA](https://www.w3.org/TR/turingtest/) or other Turing tests for most
web applications as they pose challenges with accessibility.
:::

## Redirect URLs

Supabase Auth lets you redirect back to different URLs on susccessful
authentication. Your client app can specify the URL to redirect back to using
the `redirectTo` parameter.

Given that in sophisticated attacks this parameter may come from a malicious
source, Supabase Auth implements an allow list which will be consulted prior to
sending a redirect response. Should the redirect parameter not fall in the URL
allow list, the Site URL is used.

The allow list can be a simple list of exactly matching URLs, but it also
supports wildcard characters to match them as a pattern.

:::tip
You can configure the URL allow list in the [Authentication General Settings
page](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/auth/settings) under Redirect URLs.
:::

Because wildcard patterns are also supported, you need to be careful when using
them, as you may be opening up your application to a larger attack surface.
Here are some examples of do's and don'ts.

**Dont's.**

* `**`  
This pattern would match any redirect URL.
* `com.mobile.app.*://**`  
This pattern would match any iOS application with a package name that starts
with `com.mobile.app.`. An attacker can use this to call on those apps in a
user's device.
* `https://*.com/**`  
This pattern would match any URL on the `.com` domain name. An attacker can use
this to redirect back to any website they control.

**Dos.**

* `https://app.example.com/**`  
This is the recommended form for most project use cases on the web. Any
redirects to the `app.example.com` domain will be allowed with any path. If
your project needs to support multiple such domains, add multiple entries like
this.
* `com.mobile.app://**`  
This is the recommended form for most project use cases on iOS. Any redirects
to the `com.mobile.app` application will be allowed with any path. If your
project needs to support multiple applications, add multiple entries. Avoid
using wildcards in the URL scheme!

:::tip
If you use exact or very specific URLs, make sure you always include a trailing
slash `/` as that is the proper valid form of URLs. Correct form:
`https://app.example.com/*/sign-in/`. Incorrect form:
`https://app.example.com/*/sign-in`.
