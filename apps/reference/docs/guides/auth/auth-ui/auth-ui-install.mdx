# Auth UI

Auth UI is a React component that provides a simple way to authenticate users.

It is currently only available for React, however it is planned to be available for other frameworks.

Auth UI relies on [@supabase/supabase-js](/docs/reference/javascript/next/) to work, so you will need to firstly also install [@supabase/supabase-js](/docs/reference/javascript/next/) and perhaps be already familair with that package.

### Install via NPM

Install the NPM package from @supabase/react-ui-react

```bash
npm install @supabase/react-ui-react
```

### Import Auth component

The most simplest way to use the component is to just pass `supabaseClient` from @supabase/supabase-js as a prop to the component.

```js title="/src/index.js"
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'
import { Auth } from '@supabase/react-ui-react'

const supabase = createClient(
  '<INSERT PROJECT URL>',
  '<INSERT PROJECT ANON API KEY>'
)

const App = () => <Auth supabaseClient={supabase} />
```

You may notice that the above renders the Auth component without any styling.

It is reccomended that you use one of the provided themes to style the UI.
Import the theme you want to use and pass it to the `appearence.theme` prop.

```diff js title="/src/index.js"
import {
    Auth,
+   ThemeSupa
} from '@supabase/react-ui-react'

const App = () => (
    <Auth
        supabaseClient={supabase}
+       appearance={{ theme: ThemeSupa }}
    />
)
```
