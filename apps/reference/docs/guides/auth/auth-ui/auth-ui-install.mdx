# Auth UI

Auth UI is a JavaScript library that provides a simple way to authenticate users.

It currently supports React, however support for other frameworks is planned.

Auth UI relies on [@supabase/supabase-js](/docs/reference/javascript/next/). You need to also [install @supabase/supabase-js](/docs/reference/javascript/next/installing).

### Install via NPM

Install the NPM package from @supabase/react-ui-react

```bash
npm install @supabase/react-ui-react @supabase/supabase-js@rc
```

### Import Auth component

The simplest way to use the component is to pass `supabaseClient` from @supabase/supabase-js as a prop to the component.

```js title="/src/index.js"
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'
import { Auth } from '@supabase/react-ui-react'

const supabase = createClient(
  '<INSERT PROJECT URL>',
  '<INSERT PROJECT ANON API KEY>'
)

const App = () => <Auth supabaseClient={supabase} />
```

The example above renders the Auth component without any styling.

We recommend using one of the themes provided to style the UI.
Import the theme you want to use and pass it to the `appearence.theme` prop.

```diff js title="/src/index.js"
import {
    Auth,
+   ThemeSupa
} from '@supabase/react-ui-react'

const App = () => (
    <Auth
        supabaseClient={supabase}
+       appearance={{ theme: ThemeSupa }}
    />
)
```
