To enable Notion Auth for your project, you need to set up a Notion Application and add the Application OAuth credentials to your Supabase Dashboard.

## Overview

Setting up Notion logins for your application consists of 3 parts:

- Create and configure a Notion Application [Notion Developer Portal](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)
- Retrieve your OAuth client ID and OAuth client secret and add them to your [Supabase Project](https://app.supabase.com)
- Add the login code to your [Supabase JS Client App](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js)

## Steps

### Create your notion integration

- Go to [developers.notion.com](https://developers.notion.com/).
- Click "View my integrations" and login.

- Once logged in, go to [notion.so/my-integrations](https://notion.so/my-integrations) and create a new integration.
- When creating your integration, ensure that you select "Public integration" under "Integration type" and "Read user information including email addresses" under "Capabilities".
- You will need to add a redirect uri, see [Add the redirect uri](#add-the-redirect-uri)
- Once you've filled in the necessary fields, click "Submit" to finish creating the integration.

### Add the redirect uri

- After selecting "Public integration", you should see an option to add "Redirect URIs".

You can retrieve the redirect uri with the following steps:

- Go to your [Supabase Project Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com).
- Click on the `Settings` icon at the bottom of the left sidebar.
- Click on `API` in the list.
- Under Config / URL you'll find your API URL, you can click `Copy` to copy it to the clipboard.
- Add `/auth/v1/callback` to the end of that to get your full `OAuth Redirect URI`.

Your redirect uri should look like the following: `https://<project-ref>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`

### Add your Notion credentials into your Supabase Project

- Once you've created your notion integration, you should be able to retrieve the "OAuth client ID" and "OAuth client secret" from the "OAuth Domain and URIs" tab.

- Go to your [Supabase Project Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com)
- In the left sidebar, click the `Authentication` icon (near the top)
- Click `Settings` from the list to go to the `Authentication Settings` page
- Under `External OAuth Providers` turn `Notion Enabled` to ON
- Enter the "OAuth client ID" and "OAuth client secret" obtained in the `client id` and `client secret` fields.
- Click `Save`

### Add login code to your client app

The JavaScript client code is documented here: [Supabase OAuth Client Code](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signin#sign-in-using-third-party-providers)

```js
const { user, session, error } = await supabase.auth.signIn({
  provider: 'notion',
})
```

Add this function which you can call from a button, link, or UI element.

```js
async function signInWithNotion() {
  const { user, session, error } = await supabase.auth.signIn({
    provider: 'notion',
  })
}
```

To log out:

```js
async function signout() {
  const { error } = await supabase.auth.signOut()
}
```
