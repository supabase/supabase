To enable Keycloak Auth for your project, you need to set up an Keycloak OAuth application and add the application credentials to your Supabase Dashboard.

## Overview

To get started with Keycloak, you can run it in a docker container with: `docker run -e KEYCLOAK_USER=admin -e KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD=admin -p 8080:8080 jboss/keycloak:latest`

This guide will be assuming that you are running keycloak in a docker container as described in the command above.

Keycloak OAuth consists of five broad steps:

- Create a new client in your specified keycloak realm.
- Obtain the `issuer` from the "OpenID Endpoint Configuration". This will be used as the `Keycloak URL`.
- Ensure that the new client has the "Client Protocol" set to "openid-connect" and the "Access Type" is set to "confidential".
- The `Client ID` of the client created will be used as the `client id`.
- Obtain the `Secret` from the credentials tab which will be used as the `client secret`.
- Whitelist the callback url of your application.

## Steps

### Access your Keycloak Admin console

- Login by visiting [`http://localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080) and clicking on "Administration Console".

### Create a Keycloak Realm

- Once you've logged in to the Keycloak console, you can add a realm from the side panel. The default realm should be named "Master".
- After you've added a new realm, you can retrieve the `issuer` from the "OpenID Endpoint Configuration" endpoint. The `issuer` will be used as the `Keycloak URL`.
- You can find this endpoint from the realm settings under the "General Tab" or visit [`http://localhost:8080/realms/my_realm_name/.well-known/openid-configuration`](http://localhost:8080/realms/my_realm_name/.well-known/openid-configuration)

### Create a Keycloak Client

The "Client ID" of the created client will serve as the `client_id` when you make API calls to authenticate the user.

### Client Settings

After you've created the client successfully, ensure that you set the following settings:

1. The "Client Protocol" should be set to "openid-connect".
2. The "Access Type" should be set to "confidential".
3. The "Valid Redirect URIs" should be set to: `https://<project-ref>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`.

### Obtain the Client Secret

This will serve as the `client_secret` when you make API calls to authenticate the user.
Under the "Credentials" tab, the `Secret` value will be used as the `client secret`.

### Add login code to your client app

The JavaScript client code is documented in the [Supabase OAuth Reference](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signin#sign-in-using-third-party-providers).

```js
const { user, session, error } = await supabase.auth.signIn({
  provider: 'keycloak',
})
```

Add a function which you can call from a button, link, or UI element.

```js
async function signInWithKeycloak() {
  const { user, session, error } = await supabase.auth.signIn({
    provider: 'keycloak',
  }
}
```

To log out:

```js
async function signout() {
  const { error } = await supabase.auth.signOut()
}
```

- You can find the keycloak openid endpoint configuration under the realm settings.
