To enable Apple Auth for your project, you need to set up an Apple OAuth application and add the application credentials to your Supabase Dashboard.

## Overview

Apple OAuth consists of six broad steps:

- Obtaining an `App Id` with “Sign In with Apple” capabilities.
- Obtaining a `Services Id` - this will serve as the `client_id`.
- Obtaining a `secret key` that will be used to get our `client_secret`.
- Generating the `client_secret` using the `secret key`.
- Add your `client id` and `client secret` keys to your [Supabase Project](https://app.supabase.com).
- Add the login code to your [Supabase JS Client App](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js).

## Steps

### Access your Apple Developer account

- Go to [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com).
- Click on `Account` at the top right to log in.

### Obtain an App ID

- Go to `Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles`.
- Click on `Identifiers` at the left.
- Click on the `+` sign in the upper left next to `Identifiers`.
- Select `App IDs` and click `Continue`.
- Select type `App` and click `Continue`.
- Fill out your app information:
  - App description.
  - Bundle ID (Apple recommends reverse-domain name style, so if your domain is acme.com and your app is called roadrunner, use: "com.acme.roadrunner").
  - Scroll down and check `Sign In With Apple`.
  - Click `Continue` at the top right.
  - Click `Register` at the top right.

### Obtain a Services ID

This will serve as the `client_id` when you make API calls to authenticate the user.

- Go to `Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles`.
- Click on `Identifiers` at the left.
- Click on the `+` sign in the upper left next to `Identifiers`.
- Select `Services IDs` and click `Continue`.
- Fill out your information:
  - App description.
  - Bundle ID (you can't use the same Bundle ID from the previous step, but you can just add something to the beginning, such as "app." to make it app.com.acme.roadrunner").
  - SAVE THIS ID -- this ID will become your `client_id` later.
  - Click `Continue` at the top right.
  - Click `Register` at the top right.

### Find your callback URL

The next step requires a callback URL, which looks like this:

`https://<project-ref>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`

- Go to your [Supabase Project Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com).
- Click on the `Settings` icon at the bottom of the left sidebar.
- Click on `API` in the list.
- Under Config / URL you'll find your API URL, you can click `Copy` to copy it to the clipboard.
- Now just add `/auth/v1/callback` to the end of that to get your full `OAuth Redirect URI`.

### Configure your Services ID

- Under `Identifiers`, click on your newly-created Services ID.
- Check the box next to `Sign In With Apple` to enable it.
- Click `Configure` to the right.
- Make sure your newly created Bundle ID is selected under `Primary App ID`
- Add your domain to the `Domains and Subdomains` box (do not add `https://`, just add the domain).
- In the `Return URLs` box, type the callback URL of your app which you found in the previous step and click `Next` at the bottom right.
- Click `Done` at the bottom.
- Click `Continue` at the top right.
- Click `Save` at the top right.

### Download your secret key

Now you'll need to download a `secret key` file from Apple that will be used to generate your `client_secret`.

- Go to `Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles`.
- Click on `Keys` at the left.
- Click on the `+` sign in the upper left next to `Keys`.
- Enter a `Key Name`.
- Check `Sign In with Apple`.
- Click `Configure` to the right.
- Select your newly-created Services ID from the dropdown selector.
- Click `Save` at the top right.
- Click `Continue` at the top right.
- Click `Register` at the top right.
- Click `Download` at the top right.
- Save the downloaded file -- this contains your "secret key" that will be used to generate your `client_secret`.
- Click `Done` at the top right.

### Generate a `client_secret`

The `secret key` you downloaded is used to create the `client_secret` string you'll need to authenticate your users.

According to the [Apple Docs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/signinwithapplerestapi/generate_and_validate_tokens) it needs to be a JWT
token encrypted using the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) with the P-256 curve and the SHA-256 hash algorithm.

At this time, the easiest way to generate this JWT token is with [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/).
If you don't have Ruby installed, you can [Download Ruby Here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads).

- Install Ruby (or check to make sure it's installed on your system).
- Install [ruby-jwt](https://github.com/jwt/ruby-jwt).
- From the command line, run: `sudo gem install jwt`.

Create the script below using a text editor: `secret_gen.rb`

```ruby
require "jwt"

key_file = "Path to the private key"
team_id = "Your Team ID"
client_id = "The Service ID of the service you created"
key_id = "The Key ID of the private key"

validity_period = 180 # In days. Max 180 (6 months) according to Apple docs.

private_key = OpenSSL::PKey::EC.new IO.read key_file

token = JWT.encode(
	{
		iss: team_id,
		iat: Time.now.to_i,
		exp: Time.now.to_i + 86400 * validity_period,
		aud: "https://appleid.apple.com",
		sub: client_id
	},
	private_key,
	"ES256",
	header_fields=
	{
		kid: key_id
	}
)
puts token
```

1. Edit the `secret_gen.rb` file:

- `key_file` = "Path to the private key you downloaded from Apple". It should look like this: `AuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8`.
- `team_id` = "Your Team ID". This is found at the top right of the Apple Developer site (next to your name).
- `client_id` = "The Service ID of the service you created". This is the `Services ID` you created in the above step `Obtain a Services ID`. If you've lost this ID, you can find it in the Apple Developer Site:
  - Go to `Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles`.
  - Click `Identifiers` at the left.
  - At the top right drop-down, select `Services IDs`.
  - Find your Identifier in the list (i.e. app.com.acme.roadrunner).
- `key_id` = "The Key ID of the private key". This can be found in the name of your downloaded secret file (For a file named `AuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8` your key_id is `XXXXXXXXXX`). If you've lost this ID, you can find it in the Apple Developer Site:
  - Go to `Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles`.
  - Click `Keys` at the left.
  - Click on your newly-created key in the list.
  - Look under `Key ID` to find your key_id.

2. From the command line, run: `ruby secret_gen.rb > client_secret.txt`.
3. Your `client_secret` is now stored in this `client_secret.txt` file.

### Add your OAuth credentials to Supabase

- Go to your [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com).
- In the left sidebar, click the `Authentication` icon (near the top).
- Click `Settings` from the list to go to the `Authentication Settings` page.
- Enter the final (hosted) URL of your app under `Site URL` (this is important).
- Under `External OAuth Providers` turn `Apple Enabled` to ON.
- Enter your `client_id` and `client_secret` saved in the previous steps.
- Click `Save`.

### Add login code to your client app

The JavaScript client code is documented in the [Supabase OAuth Reference](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signin#sign-in-using-third-party-providers).

```js
const { user, session, error } = await supabase.auth.signIn({
  provider: 'apple',
})
```

Add a function which you can call from a button, link, or UI element.

```js
async function signInWithApple() {
  const { user, session, error } = await supabase.auth.signIn({
    provider: 'apple',
  })
}
```

To log out:

```js
async function signout() {
  const { error } = await supabase.auth.signOut()
}
```
