:::note

Custom Domains are currently in beta, and are being slowly made available to projects.

:::

Custom domains allow you to present a branded experience to your users. You can also use a subdomain for the purposes of this guide.

To get started:

1. [Install](/docs/guides/cli) the Supabase CLI 1.10.1+.
1. [Log in](/docs/guides/cli/local-development#log-in-to-the-supabase-cli) to your Supabase account using the CLI.
1. Enable the Custom Domains add-on in the Billing page of the Dashboard.

## Configure a Custom Domain

This example assumes your Supabase project is `foobar` with a corresponding API URL `foobar.supabase.co` and configures a custom domain at `api.example.com`.

### Configure a CNAME

Set up a CNAME record for `api.example.com`, resolving to `foobarbaz.supabase.co.`, with as low a TTL as possible.

### Configure TXT Verification

Use the `create` subcommand of the CLI to notify Supabase of your domain and retrieve TXT verification records:

```bash
supabase custom-hostname create --project-ref foobar --custom-hostname api.example.com --experimental
```

The output of the `create` command includes two TXT records you will need to set up, in order to verify your control over the domain in question,
and for us to issue SSL certificates for it. For example:

```
[...]
Required outstanding validation records:
        _cf-custom-hostname.api.example.com TXT -> 46BBC14D-D50A-409C-8DB5-F862CF5BA660
        api.example.com TXT -> ca3-F1HvR9i938OgVwpCFwi1jTsbhe1hvT0Ic3efPY3Q
```

### Verify your domain

Set up both records as instructed, and then use the `reverify` command for the Supabase Platform to verify the records:

```bash
supabase custom-hostname reverify --project-ref foobarbaz --experimental
```

You might need to wait a few minutes before your updated DNS records are propagated, especially if the older records were using a high TTL.

### Activate your domain

The final activation step reconfigures your project to start serving traffic on your custom domain (`api.example.com`).
The auth service, in particular, will no longer work with the original URL (`foobar.supabase.co`).
As such, it is recommended that you schedule a downtime window of 20-30 minutes, depending on the complexity of your project, to update all the services that need to know about your custom domain:

- any client code (e.g., frontends, mobile apps)
- any OAuth providers (e.g., google, github)

Additionally, update the DNS configuration for `api.example.com` to once more use a CNAME record that resolves to `foobarbaz.supabase.co`.
Finally, you can use the `activate` subcommand to reconfigure your project:

```bash
supabase custom-hostname activate --project-ref foobarbaz --experimental
```
