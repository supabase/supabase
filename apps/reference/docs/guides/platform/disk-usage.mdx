description: Learn how database disk space usage is reported.
---


Database disk space usage refers to the _monthly average disk usage_, as reported by Postgres. This metric is reported in your project's [billing page](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/settings/billing) and is updated daily.

For an instantaneous live view of the DB disk space being used by your project, you can execute in Postgres:

```sql
SELECT SUM(pg_database_size(pg_database.datname)) / (1024 * 1024) as db_size_mb FROM pg_database;
```

This value is also reported in the [database settings page](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/settings/database).

## Vacuuming

:::note

Vacuuming operations can temporarily increase resource utilization, which in turn can adversely impact the observed performance of your project while the maintenance is completed.

:::

Postgres does not immediately reclaim the physical space used by dead tuples (e.g. deleted rows) in the db. Instead, they get internally marked as removed until a ["vacuum" operation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/routine-vacuuming.html) is executed. A common manifestation of this mechanism is that deleting data from your DB can sometimes result in the reported disk usage not immediately decreasing by a commensurate amount.

Supabase projects come with automatic vacuuming enabled, which ensures that these operations are performed regularly, in order to keep the database healthy and performant. However, it can sometimes be necessary to either [fine-tune](https://www.percona.com/blog/2018/08/10/tuning-autovacuum-in-postgresql-and-autovacuum-internals/) [the autovacuum parameters](https://www.enterprisedb.com/blog/postgresql-vacuum-and-analyze-best-practice-tips), or [manually initiate](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-vacuum.html) vacuum operations. As an example, running a manual vacuum after deleting large amounts of data from your DB could help reduce the reported disk usage by Postgres.
