Supabase Broadcast allows a client to broadcast messages and multiple receivers to receive the broadcasted message. The broadcasted messages are emphermal, they are not persisted to the database and are directly relayed by the Realtime server.

To broadcast a message

```js
const { createClient } = require('@supabase/supabase-js')

const supabase = createClient(
  process.env.SUPABASE_URL,
  process.env.SUPABASE_KEY
)

// The name of the channel can be set to any string.
// Set the same name across both the broadcasting and receiving clients.
const channel = supabase.channel('broadcastChannel', {
  configs: {
    broadcast: { ack: true },
  },
})

// subscribe registers your client with the server
channel.subscribe(async (status) => {
  if (status === 'SUBSCRIBED') {
    // now you can start broadcasting messages
    // sending a new message every second
    setInterval(async () => {
      const status = await channel.send({
        type: 'broadcast',
        event: 'post',
        payload: { x: 0, y: 0 },
      })

      console.log(status)
    }, 1000)
  }
})
```

To receive the broadcasted message, run this script in another tab

```js
const { createClient } = require('@supabase/supabase-js')

const supabase = createClient(
  process.env.SUPABASE_URL,
  process.env.SUPABASE_KEY
)

// use the same channel name as the client broadcasting the message is using
const channel = supabase.channel('broadcastChannel')

// listen to broadcasts
channel
  .on('broadcast', { event: 'post' }, (payload) => console.log(payload))
  .subscribe(async (status) => {
    if (status === 'SUBSCRIBED') {
      console.log(status)
      // your callback function will now be called with the received messages
    }
  })
```
