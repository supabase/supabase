title: Realtime Limits
description: Realtime Rate Limiting
---

Since deploying a global multi-tenant cluster for Supabase Realtime, we've implimented some rate limits to protect our infrastructure.

Rate limits are mostly configurable per project and our cluster can support millions of concurrent connections if needed. If you're running into any rate limiting and it's causing issues, please [contact support](https://app.supabase.com/support/new).

## Limits by Plan

Limits are set on the Free and Pro plans accordingly. See our [pricing page](https://supabase.com/pricing) for more information.

Above the Pro plan Realtime is billed on a usage basis. We still employ limiting above the Pro plan to protect our infrastructure. If you're on an Enterprise plan simply contact support and we'll increase your limits as needed.

Enterprise plan limits start at:

- 500 concurrent users
- 1,000 messages per second
- 500 concurrent Channels

## System Limits

Some limits apply to all projects and are not currently configurable per project.

- 500 Channel joins per second
- 100 Channels per connected user

## Client-side Limiting

Some basic WebSocket message rate limiting has been implimented client-side.

See the [Cursor Positions Quickstart](/docs/guides/realtime/quickstart#cursor-positions) section where a `eventsPerSecond` parameter is passed in when instantiating the Supabase client.

- Default: `10` events per second

## Rate Limiting Errors

Errors could be generated in two places: the backend logs, a message in WebSocket.

:::note
Use the [Realtime Inspector](https://realtime.supabase.com/inspector/new) to reproduce an error and share those connection details with Supabase support.

### Backend Logs

If your project is being rate limited, check your [Realtime logs](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/database/realtime-logs).

### WebSocket Errors

- `tenant_events`: In the event your project is generating too many messages per second clients will be disconnected. `supabase-js` will attempt to reconnect automatically. It should reconnect successfully if the rate limit decreases appropriately.

Some limits will cause a Channel join to be refused. In this case a reply in the WebSocket will be one of:

- `too_many_channels`: Too many channels currently joined for a single user.
- `too_many_connections`: Too many total concurrent connections for a project.
- `too_many_joins`: Too many Channel joins per second.

:::note
Use Chroms DevTools to find the WebSocket initiation request and view individual messages.

## Payload Limits

Realtime has a PubSub message payload size limit of 1 megabyte.
