## Initializing the client library

```dart
final supabase = SupabaseClient('<SUPABASE_URL>', '<SUPABASE_ANON_KEY>');
```


### Attributes




### Notes

## Dart
You can initialize a new Supabase client using the `SupabaseClient()` method.

The Supabase client is your entrypoint to the rest of the Supabase functionality
and is the easiest way to interact with everything we offer within the Supabase ecosystem.


## Flutter

For `supabase_flutter`, you will be using the static `initialize()` method on `Supabase` class.


### Examples



#### 

```dart
final supabase = SupabaseClient('https://xyzcompany.supabase.co', 'public-anon-key');
```




#### 

```dart title="main.dart"
Future<void> main() async {
  await Supabase.initialize(url: 'https://xyzcompany.supabase.co', anonKey: 'public-anon-key');
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```






## Create a new user.

```dart
final res = await supabase.auth.signUp('<USER_EMAIL>', '<USER_PASSWORD>');
```


### Attributes




### Notes

- By default, the user will need to verify their email address before logging in. If you would like to change this, you can disable "Email Confirmations" by going to Authentication -> Settings on [app.supabase.com](https://app.supabase.com)
- If "Email Confirmations" is turned on, a user is returned but session will be null
- If "Email Confirmations" is turned off, both a `user` and a `session` will be returned
- When the user confirms their email address, they will be redirected to localhost:3000 by default. To change this, you can go to Authentication -> Settings on [app.supabase.com](https://app.supabase.com)


### Examples



#### Sign up.

```dart
final res = await supabase.auth.signUp('example@email.com', 'example-password');

final user = res.data?.user;
final error = res.error;
```




#### Sign up with third-party providers.

```dart
// Use signInWithProvider()
```
