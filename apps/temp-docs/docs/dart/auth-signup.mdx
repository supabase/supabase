Creates a new user.

<Tabs
  defaultActiveId="dart"
  groupId="reference/dart"
  values={[{ label: 'Dart', value: 'dart' }]}>

<TabsPanel id="dart" label="dart">

```dart
final res = await supabase.auth.signUp('example@email.com',　'example-password');

final user = res.data?.user;
final error = res.error;
```

</TabsPanel>

</Tabs>

## Notes

- By default, the user will need to verify their email address before logging in. If you would like to change this, you can disable "Email Confirmations" by going to Authentication -> Settings on [app.supabase.com](https://app.supabase.com)
- If "Email Confirmations" is turned on, a `user` is returned but `session` will be null
- If "Email Confirmations" is turned off, both a `user` and a `session` will be returned
- When the user confirms their email address, they will be redirected to localhost:3000 by default. To change this, you can go to Authentication -> Settings on [app.supabase.com](https://app.supabase.com)
