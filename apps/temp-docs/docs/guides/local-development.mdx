Supabase provides a CLI so that you can develop your application locally, rather than connecting to a live project.

## Before you begin

If you're using the CLI, please record your steps! You can help us improve by adding missing details and fixing errors. 

Our CLI is still under heavy development, and is missing some features:

- The self-hosted version of Supabase does not include a UI yet.
We are working on this in stages, starting with our [UI library](https://github.com/supabase/ui) 
([more context](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/discussions/1001#discussioncomment-558696)).

In the meantime, here are some suggested tools for interacting with your Postgres Database:

- `pgadmin`: https://www.pgadmin.org 
- `dbeaver`: https://dbeaver.com 
- `BeeKeeper`: https://beekeeperstudio.io
- `HeidiSQL`: https://heidisql.com
- `Table Plus`: https://www.tableplus.io

## Prerequisites

You will need to have these in your environment:
- Git
- Docker (make sure the daemon is up and running)
- Supabase CLI (instructions [here](https://github.com/supabase/cli))

## Initialize your project

```bash
supabase init
```

This command will create a `supabase` folder which holds all the configuration for developing your project locally.

## Start

```bash
supabase start
```

This command uses Docker Compose to start all the open source [services](/docs/#how-it-works) of Supabase. This command will take a while to run, there are a lot of services to build.

Once this is running, you will see an output that contains your local Supabase credentials:

```txt
Started local development setup.
API URL: http://localhost:54321
DB URL: postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres
anon key: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJyb2xlIjoiYW5vbiJ9.ZopqoUt20nEV9cklpv9e3yw3PVyZLmKs5qLD6nGL1SI
service_role key: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJyb2xlIjoic2VydmljZV9yb2xlIn0.M2d2z4SFn5C7HlJlaSLfrzuYim9nbY_XI40uWFN3hEE
```

#### Accessing Services Directly


<Tabs
defaultActiveId="Postgres"
values={[
  {label: 'Postgres', value: 'Postgres'},
  {label: 'API Gateway', value: 'Kong'},
]}>
<TabsPanel id="Postgres" label="Postgres">

```sh
# Default URL:
postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres
```

The local Postgres instance can be accessed through [`psql`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html) 
or any other Postgres client, such as [pgadmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/).

For example:

```bash
psql 'postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres'
```

</TabsPanel>
<TabsPanel id="Kong" label="Kong">

```sh
# Default URL:
http://localhost:54321
```

All of the services are accessible through the API Gateway [Kong](https://github.com/Kong/kong)). 
If you are accessing these services without the client libraries, you may need to pass the client keys as an `Authorization` header. 
You can learn more about these JWT headers in our [Resources](/docs/learn/auth-deep-dive/auth-deep-dive-jwts).

```sh
curl 'http://localhost:54321/rest/v1/' \
    -H "apikey: SUPABASE_KEY" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer SUPABASE_KEY"

http://localhost:54321/v1/rest/v1/           # REST (PostgREST)
http://localhost:54321/v1/realtime/v1/       # Realtime
http://localhost:54321/v1/storage/v1/        # Storage
http://localhost:54321/v1/auth/v1/           # Auth (GoTrue)
```


</TabsPanel>
</Tabs>


## Example application

Now that we've learned how to install and start Supabase locally, let's see how you can use it with a frontend application. 
This quick-start guide will show you, how you can configure a React app which uses the Supabase stack.

```bash
# create a fresh React app
npx create-react-app react-demo --use-npm

# move into the new folder
cd react-demo

# set up Supabase 
supabase init 

# Save the install supabase-js library
npm install --save @supabase/supabase-js
```

Now that your application is prepared, start the backend:

```bash
supabase start  # Start Supabase
```

You can use Supabase anywhere in your application. Copy this snippet into `App.js`:

```js
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

const SUPABASE_URL = '<your API URL>'
const SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = '<your anon key>'

const supabase = createClient(SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY)
```

Then start the frontend in a separate terminal:

```bash
npm start       # Start the React app
```

If everything is working, you should have a React app running on `http://localhost:3000` and Supabase services running on `http://localhost:54321`

## Stop

When you're finished with Supabase, send <kbd>Ctrl-C</kbd> to stop the Docker services.

## Migrations

You can also use the CLI to manage your migrations. Follow the the tour [here](https://github.com/supabase/cli/tree/main/examples/tour) to get started.
