In Postgres, data is stored in "tables".
Tables are similar to excel spreadsheets. They contain columns & rows of data. There are a few key differences from a spreadsheet however:

- Every column is a strict type of data. When you set up a column, you must define the "data type".
- Tables can be "joined" together. For example you can have a `users` table, which is joined to a `teams` table (because users belong to teams).

For example, this table has 3 "columns" (`id`, `name`, `description`) and 4 "rows" of data:

| `id`    | `name` | `description` |
| ----  | ---- | ----------- |
|    1 | Toy Story | When a new toy called "Forky" joins Woody and the gang, a road trip alongside old and new friends reveals how big the world can be for a toy. |
|    2 | Monsters, Inc. | In order to power the city, monsters have to scare children so that they scream. However, the children are toxic to monsters. |
|    3 | Finding Nemo | After his son is captured in the Great Barrier Reef and taken to Sydney, a timid clownfish sets out on a journey to bring him home. |
|    4 | WALL-E | In the distant future, a small waste-collecting robot inadvertently embarks on a space journey that will ultimately decide the fate of mankind. |


## Creating Tables

Supabase provides several options for creating tables. You can use the Table Editor or create them directly using SQL.
We provide a SQL editor within the Dashboard, or you can [connect](/docs/guides/database/connecting/connecting-to-postgres) to your database
and run the SQL queries yourself.


<Tabs
defaultActiveId="UI"
values={[
  {label: 'UI', value: 'UI'},
  {label: 'SQL', value: 'SQL'},
]}>
<TabsPanel id="UI" label="UI">

```sh
1. Go to the "Table editor" section.
2. Click "New Table".
3. Enter the table name "todos".
4. Click "Save".
5. Click "New Column".
6. Enter the column name "task" and make the type "text".
7. Click "Save".
```

```sql
-- Create a table called "todos" with a column to store tasks.

create table todos (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  task text check (char_length(task) > 3)
);
```

### Tips

- It is best practice to use lowercase and underscores when naming tables. For example: `table_name`, not `Table Name`.
- Tables belong to `schemas`. If you don't explicitly pass the schema, Postgres will assume that you want to create the table in the `public` schema.


### Data types

Every column is a predefined type. PostgreSQL provides many [default types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype.html), and you can even design your own (or use extensions) if the default types don't fit your needs.

Here's a list of the data types that are available to use in the table editor in the Dashboard:

| `Name`                                        | `Description`              | `Example`                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| int2       | Can contain numbers between -32,768 and 32,767 | For storing numbers like ages of people, distance between places or numbers you know will be fairly small.  |
| int4       | Can contain numbers between -2,147,483,648 and +2,147,483,648  | For storing numbers like the population of small towns or cities that you know will be less than about 2 billion. |
| int8       | Can contain numbers between 9,223,372,036,854,775,808 and +9,223,372,036,854,775,808 | For storing numbers larger than roughly 2 billion. Like the number of people who live in the Northern vs Southern hemisphere or the total number of COVID-19 vaccinations administered. |
| float4     | Can contain numbers with up to 6 decimal places   | For storing things like temperature (22.5 degrees Celsius) or distance (10.25kms)|
| float8     | Can contain numbers with up to 15 decimal places   | For storing numbers with a high level of precision, like scientific or mathematical data.  |
| numeric    | Can contain 131,072 digits before the decimal point and 16,383 digits after the decimal point. | For storing number that require very high precision. Use the numeric type when you need more precision than float4 or float8 offer. |
| json       | Can contain JSON data.  | For storing data that logically belongs together, like a person's street address. Useful for when you want to store dynamic fields and not have every field represented as a column in your table.  |
| jsonb      | The JSONB type stores your JSON input as a binary code instead of as an exact copy of the JSON data. JSONB is faster, more efficient and supports indexing.    |  If you are doing a lot of JSON manipulation in Postgres you should consider using JSONB for efficiency. Otherwise, if you are just doing typical data storing and fetching, JSON should be fine.  |
| text       | Can contain strings of any length. | For storing any kind of textual data. Examples include text contents of recipes or blog posts. This is the general purpose data type for textual content.    |
| varchar    | Can contain strings with a fixed length | For storing a string where you would want to limit the length to 160 characters.     |
| uuid       | Can store a universal unique identifier. | For storing unique IDs, like when you need to store a reference to another table row.  |
| date       | Can store a data value without time. |  For storing dates like birthdays or holidays with a year, month and day.  |
| time       | Can store the time of day |  For storing things like when a process starts and stops at specific times in the day. The lights come on at 6:00:00 a.m. and go off at 10:00:00 p.m. |
| timez      | Can store the time of day, along with a timezone. | For storing things like event start times,  like an Apple event starting at 10:00:00 a.m. Pacific Time. |
| timestamp  | Can store the date and time without a timezone.  | For storing times like: May 1st, 2022 at 10 a.m.  |
| timestampz | Can store the date and time with a timezone.  | For storing times like: May 1st, 2022 at 10 a.m, Pacific Time. |
| bool       | Can store boolean values  | For storing things that will be true or false, like user_is_subscribed or show_homepage_ad. |
