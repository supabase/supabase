Before we store any information in Supabase, we need to understand how data is
organized in Postgres. Supabase uses Postgres as its database, which means data
is arranged in a structured and predictable way. This helps keep your app
organized, consistent, and easy to query.

The core ideas are simple: you create tables to hold related data, and each
table has rows (records) and columns (fields). Once you understand that pattern,
you can model almost anything.

## Tables, rows, and columns

A table is like a spreadsheet. It has:

- **Columns**: the fields that define what kind of data the table stores
- **Rows**: the individual entries in the table

Imagine a table for storing notes:

```text
| id | content          | created_at           |
|----|------------------|----------------------|
| 1  | Buy groceries    | 2025-01-10 14:22:11  |
| 2  | Call the dentist | 2025-01-10 15:08:54  |
```

- Each **row** is a single note.
- Each **column** represents one piece of information about the note.

## Data types

Every column has a data type. This describes the kind of value that can be
stored there.

Some common data types:

```text
| Data type   | Example value    | Meaning                       |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------- |
| text        | Hello world      | A string of characters        |
| integer     | 42               | A number without decimals     |
| boolean     | true             | Yes/no or on/off values       |
| timestamptz | 2025-01-10 14:22 | Date and time (with timezone) |
| json        | {"name": "John"} | A JSON object                 |
```

Choosing correct types makes your data easier to work with and protects you from
unexpected values.

## Primary keys

Most tables include a primary key. This is a column that uniquely identifies each
row. In many Supabase projects, this column is named `id` and uses a type called
`uuid`, which automatically generates a unique value.

You create this column in the table definition like this:

```text
id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid()
```

You generally don't need to think about it after setting it up. It simply gives
each record a stable identity.

---

## Relationships between tables

You can link tables together using foreign keys. This is how you express things
like:

- A user has many notes
- A project has many tasks
- A team has many members

For example:

```text
| id | user_id                              | content          | created_at           |
|----|--------------------------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| 1  | 9f1b1c94-3e7b-4d6a-9fa7-1e2a3c4ba987 | Buy groceries    | 2025-01-10 14:22:11  |
| 2  | 9f1b1c94-3e7b-4d6a-9fa7-1e2a3c4ba987 | Call the dentist | 2025-01-10 15:08:54  |
```

Here, `user_id` refers to a row in a `users` table. This means the note belongs
to that user, and we can see that this user has two notes.

Relationships let you organize data without repeating information.

## Why relational data is useful in practice

Relational data is really useful in practice because it allows you to:

- Keep data valid with constraints <br />
  _Example: no duplicate emails._

- Link records safely with foreign keys <br />
  _Example: delete a user and their notes in one action._

- Express real permissions with RLS <br />
  _Example: users can read their own notes; admins can read all._

- Query exactly what you need with table joins <br />
  _Example: fetch notes with the author's email._

## What we learned

A database in Supabase is made up of tables.
Each table has:

- columns (which describe the type of information stored)
- rows (the individual pieces of data in that table)

You can relate tables to each other using foreign keys.
This lets you model real situations, such as:

- a user has many notes
- a team has many members
- a project has many tasks

Thinking in tables, rows, and relationships is the foundation of working with data in Supabase.
