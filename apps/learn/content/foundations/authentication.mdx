title: Authentication
description: Learn how Supabase manages users and how signed-in requests connect to the database.

Most applications need to know who is using them. Authentication is how we identify
a user and attach their actions to their own data. Supabase includes an
authentication system that works directly with the database, so user identity
flows naturally into queries and permissions.

Authentication in Supabase is handled by Supabase Auth. It manages creating
accounts, signing in, and issuing tokens that represent the current user.

## Users

A user in Supabase has an id and some optional profile information (such as
email). When someone signs up, Supabase creates a new user record and assigns
them a unique identifier.

You do not need to create or manage the users table yourself. Supabase stores it
internally and keeps it updated.

Example of the kind of data Supabase stores for a user:

```text
id: 74d2...af1
email: maria@example.com
created: 2025-01-12 09:44:21
```

You can reference this user id in your tables when you want to link data to a
specific user.

## Tokens and identity

When a user signs in, Supabase returns a token. This token proves who the user
is. Your application includes this token in each API request.

Inside the database, this token becomes the value returned by `auth.uid()`.
This lets policies decide which data belongs to which user.

For example:

```text
select auth.uid();
```

returns the id of the signed-in user who made the request.

## Sign up and sign in

Supabase Auth supports several sign-in methods:

- Email and password
- Magic links (sign in by clicking a link in an email)
- OAuth providers (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- Phone number (SMS)

For now, we will use email and password, since it is the simplest starting point.

## Where authentication connects to data

Authentication by itself only identifies a user. It does not control access.
The next step is **Row Level Security (RLS)**. RLS uses the user id from the
token to decide which rows the user can read or write.

So the flow looks like this:

```text
User signs in
↓
Supabase gives the client a user token
↓
Client sends token with API requests
↓
Postgres receives token and sets auth.uid()
↓
RLS policies use auth.uid() to enforce access rules
```

Authentication says who the user is.
RLS decides what they are allowed to do.

## What we learned

- Supabase Auth manages user accounts and sign-in.
- Each user has a unique id that you can reference in your tables.
- When a user signs in, Supabase provides a token.
- The token tells the database who the user is through `auth.uid()`.
- Authentication by itself does not control access. RLS does that part.

Understanding this identity flow is important before we begin writing policies.
