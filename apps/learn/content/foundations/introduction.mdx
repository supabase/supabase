Welcome to Supabase Foundations — a course designed to help you understand what
Supabase is and how its parts work together.

Supabase is an open source platform built around a database called Postgres. It
adds a set of services that make the database easier to use when building
applications: Authentication for managing users, Storage for files,
Realtime for live updates, Edge Functions for running server-side code, and lots more.
These pieces are already connected, which means you can focus on your data and your
app instead of setting up separate systems.

In this course, you will start with the fundamentals. You'll create a table in your
database, store and retrieve data, and learn how to control access with Row Level
Security (RLS). Each lesson will build on the last, introducing new parts of
Supabase in small, practical steps.

By the end, you'll understand what Supabase is, how its services fit together, and
how to use it as a starting point for your own projects.
