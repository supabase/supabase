To supplement HTTP status codes, Supabase Auth returns a string error code which gives you more insight into what went wrong. These codes are stable and can be used to present an internationalized message to your users.

| Code                                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| `bad_json`                              | Usually used when the HTTP body of the request is not valid JSON.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| `bad_oauth_callback`                    | OAuth callback from provider to Auth does not have all the required attributes (state). Indicates an issue with the OAuth provider or client library implementation.                                                                                                                                          |

| `conflict`                              | General database conflict, such as concurrent requests on resources that should not be modified concurrently. Can often occur when you have too many session refresh requests firing off at the same time for a user. Check your app for concurrency issues, and if detected, back off exponentially.         |
| `email_address_not_authorized`          | Email sending is not allowed for this address as your project is using the default SMTP service. Emails can only be sent to members in your Supabase organization. If you want to send emails to others, please set up a [custom SMTP provider](/docs/guides/auth/auth-smtp).                                 |
| `email_conflict_identity_not_deletable` | Unlinking this identity causes the user's account to change to an email address which is already used by another user account. Indicates an issue where the user has two different accounts using different primary email addresses. You may need to migrate user data to one of their accounts in this case. |

| `flow_state_not_found`                  | PKCE flow state to which the API request relates no longer exists. Flow states expire after a while and are progressively cleaned up, which can cause this error. Retried requests can cause this error, as the previous request likely destroyed the flow state. Ask the user to sign in again.              |
| `hook_payload_over_size_limit`          | Payload from Auth exceeds maximum size limit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| `hook_timeout_after_retry`              | Unable to reach hook after maximum number of retries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| `not_admin`                             | User accessing the API is not admin, i.e. the JWT does not contain a `role` claim that identifies them as an admin of the Auth server.                                                                                                                                                                        |

| `over_request_rate_limit`               | Too many requests have been sent by this client (IP address). Ask the user to try again in a few minutes. Sometimes can indicate a bug in your application that mistakenly sends out too many requests (such as a badly written [`useEffect` React hook](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect)).       |

| `provider_email_needs_verification`     | Not all OAuth providers verify their user's email address. Supabase Auth requires emails to be verified, so this error is sent out when a verification email is sent after completing the OAuth flow.                                                                                                         |
| `reauthentication_needed`               | A user needs to reauthenticate to change their password. Ask the user to reauthenticate by calling the `supabase.auth.reauthenticate()` API.                                                                                                                                                                  |

| `same_password`                         | A user that is updating their password must use a different password than the one currently used.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `saml_assertion_no_email`               | SAML assertion (user information) was received after sign in, but no email address was found in it, which is required. Check the provider's attribute mapping and/or configuration.                                                                                                                           |
| `saml_assertion_no_user_id`             | SAML assertion (user information) was received after sign in, but a user ID (called NameID) was not found in it, which is required. Check the SAML identity provider's configuration.                                                                                                                         |
| `saml_entity_id_mismatch`               | (Admin API.) Updating the SAML metadata for a SAML identity provider is not possible, as the entity ID in the update does not match the entity ID in the database. This is equivalent to creating a new identity provider, and you should do that instead.                                                    |
| `saml_idp_already_exists`               | (Admin API.)

| `saml_idp_not_found`                    | SAML identity provider not found. Most often returned after IdP-initiated sign-in with an unregistered SAML identity provider in Supabase Auth.                                                                                                                                                               |
| `saml_metadata_fetch_failed`            | (Admin API.) Adding or updating a SAML provider failed as its metadata could not be fetched from the provided URL.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `saml_provider_disabled`                | Using [Enterprise SSO with SAML 2.0](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/enterprise-sso/auth-sso-saml) is not enabled on the Auth server.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `saml_relay_state_expired`              | SAML relay state is an object that tracks the progress of a `supabase.auth.signInWithSSO()` request. The SAML identity provider should respond after a fixed amount of time, after which this error is shown. Ask the user to sign in again.                                                                  |
| `saml_relay_state_not_found`            | SAML relay states are progressively cleaned up after they expire, which can cause this error. Ask the user to sign in again.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `session_not_found`                     | Session to which the API request relates no longer exists. This can occur if the user has signed out, or the session entry in the database was deleted in some other way.                                                                                                                                     |
