<Admonition type="caution">

- If you're planning to migrate a database larger than 6 GB, we recommend [upgrading to at least a Large compute add-on](/docs/guides/platform/compute-add-ons). This will ensure you have the necessary resources to handle the migration efficiently.

- For databases smaller than 150 GB, you can increase the size of the disk on paid projects by navigating to [Database Settings](/dashboard/project/_/settings/database).

- If you're dealing with a database larger than 150 GB, we strongly advise you to [contact our support team](/dashboard/support/new) for assistance in provisioning the required resources and ensuring a smooth migration process.
