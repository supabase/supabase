### Fetch requests to API endpoints aren't showing the session

You must pass along the cookie header with the fetch request in order for your API endpoint to get access to the cookie from this request.

```ts
const res = await fetch('http://localhost/contact', {
  headers: {
    cookie: headers().get('cookie') as string,
  },
})
```

### Performing administration tasks on the server side with the `service_role` `secret`

By default, the auth-helpers do not permit the use of the `service_role` `secret`. This restriction is in place to prevent the accidental exposure of your `service_role` `secret` to the public. Since the auth-helpers function on both the server and client side, it becomes challenging to separate the key specifically for client-side usage.

However, there is a solution. You can create a separate Supabase client using the `createClient` method from `@supabase/supabase-js` and provide it with the `service_role` `secret`. In a server environment, you will also need to disable certain properties to ensure proper functionality.

By implementing this approach, you can safely utilize the `service_role` `secret` without compromising security or exposing sensitive information to the public.

```ts
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, serviceRoleSecret, {
  auth: {
    persistSession: false,
    autoRefreshToken: false,
    detectSessionInUrl: false,
  },
})
```
