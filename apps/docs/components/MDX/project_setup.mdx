## Project setup

Before we start building we're going to set up our Database and API. This is as simple as starting a new Project in Supabase and then creating a "schema" inside the database.

### Create a project

1. [Create a new project](https://supabase.com/dashboard) in the Supabase Dashboard.
1. Enter your project details.
1. Wait for the new database to launch.

### Set up the database schema

Now we are going to set up the database schema. We can use the "User Management Starter" quickstart in the SQL Editor, or you can just copy/paste the SQL from below and run it yourself.

<Tabs
  scrollable
  size="small"
  type="underlined"
  defaultActiveId="dashboard"
>
<TabPanel id="dashboard" label="Dashboard">

1. Go to the [SQL Editor](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/sql) page in the Dashboard.
2. Click **User Management Starter**.
3. Click **Run**.

</TabPanel>
<TabPanel id="sql" label="SQL">

<UserManagementSQLTemplate />

</TabPanel>
</Tabs>

### Get the API Keys

Now that you've created some database tables, you are ready to insert data using the auto-generated API.
We just need to get the Project URL and `anon` key from the API settings.

1. Go to the [API Settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/api) page in the Dashboard.
1. Find your Project `URL`, `anon`, and `service_role` keys on this page.
