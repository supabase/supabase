- Go to your [Supabase Project Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
- Click on the `Authentication` icon in the left sidebar
- Click on [`Providers`](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers) under the Configuration section
- Click on **{props.provider}** from the accordion list to expand and you'll find your **Redirect URL**, you can click `Copy` to copy it to the clipboard
