The next step requires a callback URL, which looks like this:

`https://<project-ref>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`

- Go to your [Supabase Project Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com)
- Click on the `Authentication` icon in the left sidebar
- Click on [`Providers`](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/auth/providers) under the Configuration section
- Click on **{props.provider}** from the accordion list to expand and you'll find your **Redirect URL**, you can click `Copy` to copy it to the clipboard
