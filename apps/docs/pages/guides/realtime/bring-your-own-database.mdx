Realtime Database Changes works with any Postgres database that has logical replication enabled and the [wal2json](https://github.com/eulerto/wal2json) extension installed.

<Admonition type="note">

After setting up your database for Realtime, [submit a support ticket](https://supabase.com/dashboard/support/new) if you want to use your database with hosted Supabase Realtime.

</Admonition>

The following steps will make sure that your database is properly set up to work with Realtime.

## `wal2json` Extension

Realtime relies on the `wal2json` Postgres extension to format database changes to JSON which are then sent to Realtime subscribers.

Postgres databases managed by AWS RDS and Google Cloud SQL should already have `wal2json` installed.
Please check to make sure this is indeed the case with your Postgres database.

## Logical Replication Configuration

Realtime relies on Postgres' logical replication functionality to get database changes. Please enable logical replication on your database and configure the following settings:

- `max_replication_slots`: we recommend `10` because Realtime requires a few slots plus the slots you'll need for your non-Realtime logical replication needs.
- `max_slot_wal_keep_size`: we recommend `1024` (MB) so Realtime can attempt to deliver more database changes stored in Postgres.

## Realtime Database Setup

### `supabase_realtime` Publication

Create `supabase_realtime` publication and add tables you want Realtime to listen to:

```sql
create publication supabase_realtime with (publish = 'insert, update, delete');

alter publication supabase_realtime add table messages, users;
```

<Admonition type="tip">

If the payload contains a `401 Unauthorized` then you will need to grant `select` privileges to the table for the database role you want to authorize to receive database changes:

```sql
grant select on table messages to anon;
```

</Admonition>

### `realtime` Schema

Create a `realtime` schema:

```sql
create schema realtime;
```

### `supabase_realtime_admin` Role

Create a `supabase_realtime_admin` database role and grant it replication permissions:

```sql
create role supabase_realtime_admin with noinherit login password 'secure-password';
```

Make sure to grant `supabase_realtime_admin` role with replication permissions. This step will vary based on your database provider.

For example, if your database is managed by AWS RDS then you can run:

```sql
grant rds_replication to supabase_realtime_admin;
```

### `supabase_realtime_admin` Privileges

Grant `supabase_realtime_admin` privileges for `realtime` schema and all related Realtime objects:

```sql
grant all on schema realtime to supabase_realtime_admin;
grant all on all tables in schema realtime to supabase_realtime_admin;
grant all on all sequences in schema realtime to supabase_realtime_admin;
grant all on all routines in schema realtime to supabase_realtime_admin;
```

### `authenticated` Role

Create an `authenticated` role:

```sql
create role authenticated nologin noinherit;
```

<Admonition type="note">

This role is hardcoded into Realtime migrations so it's required for the time being.
