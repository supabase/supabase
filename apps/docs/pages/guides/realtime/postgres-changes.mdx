}

Realtime's Postgres Changes feature listens for database changes and sends them to clients. Clients are required to subscribe with a JWT dictating which changes they are allowed to receive based on the database's [Row Level Security](/docs/guides/auth/row-level-security).

Anyone with access to a valid JWT signed with the project's JWT secret is able to listen to your database's changes, unless tables have [Row Level Security](/docs/guides/auth/row-level-security) enabled and policies in place.

Clients can choose to receive `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, or `*` (all) changes for all changes in a schema, a table in a schema, or a column's value in a table. Your clients should only listen to tables in the `public` schema and you must first enable the tables you want your clients to listen to.

## Quick start

Let's explore how to implement Realtime Postgres Changes so you can integrate it into your use case.

  <StepHikeCompact.Step step={6}>
    <StepHikeCompact.Details title="Listen to changes by schema">

    Listen to changes on all tables in the `public` schema by setting the `schema` property to 'public' and event name to `*`. The event name can be one of:
      - `INSERT`
      - `UPDATE`
      - `DELETE`
      - `*`

    The channel name can be any string except 'realtime'.

## Available filters

Realtime offers filters so you can specify the data your client receives at a more granular level.

### eq

To listen to changes when a column's value in a table equals a client-specified value:

```js
const channel = supabase
  .channel('changes')
  .on(
    'postgres_changes',
    {
      event: 'UPDATE',
      schema: 'public',
      table: 'messages',
      filter: 'body=eq.hey',
    },
    (payload) => console.log(payload)
  )
  .subscribe()
```

<Admonition type="note">This filter uses Postgres' `=`.</Admonition>

### neq

To listen to changes when a column's value in a table does not equal a client-specified value:

```js
const channel = supabase
  .channel('changes')
  .on(
    'postgres_changes',
    {
      event: 'INSERT',
      schema: 'public',
      table: 'messages',
      filter: 'body=neq.bye',
    },
    (payload) => console.log(payload)
  )
  .subscribe()
```

<Admonition type="note">This filter uses Postgres' `!=`.</Admonition>

### lt

To listen to changes when a column's value in a table is less than a client-specified value:

```js
const channel = supabase
  .channel('changes')
  .on(
    'postgres_changes',
    {
      event: 'INSERT',
      schema: 'public',
      table: 'messages',
      filter: 'id=lt.100',
    },
    (payload) => console.log(payload)
  )
  .subscribe()
```

<Admonition type="note">
  This filter uses Postgres' `<` so it works for non-numeric types but make sure to check the expected behavior of the compared data's type.
</Admonition>

### lte

To listen to changes when a column's value in a table is less than or equal to a client-specified value:

```js
const channel = supabase
  .channel('changes')
  .on(
    'postgres_changes',
    {
      event: 'UPDATE',
      schema: 'public',
      table: 'profiles',
      filter: 'age=lte.65',
    },
    (payload) => console.log(payload)
  )
  .subscribe()
```

<Admonition type="note">
  This filter uses Postgres' `<=` so it works for non-numeric types but make sure to check the expected behavior of the compared data's type.
</Admonition>

### gt

To listen to changes when a column's value in a table is greater than a client-specified value:

```js
const channel = supabase
  .channel('changes')
  .on(
    'postgres_changes',
    {
      event: 'INSERT',
      schema: 'public',
      table: 'products',
      filter: 'quantity=gt.10',
    },
    (payload) => console.log(payload)
  )
  .subscribe()
```

<Admonition type="note">
  This filter uses Postgres' `>` so it works for non-numeric types but make sure to check the
  expected behavior of the compared data's type.
</Admonition>

### gte

To listen to changes when a column's value in a table is greater than or equal to a client-specified value:

```js
const channel = supabase
  .channel('changes')
  .on(
    'postgres_changes',
    {
      event: 'INSERT',
      schema: 'public',
      table: 'products',
      filter: 'quantity=gte.10',
    },
    (payload) => console.log(payload)
  )
  .subscribe()
```

<Admonition type="note">
  This filter uses Postgres' `>=` so it works for non-numeric types but make sure to check the
  expected behavior of the compared data's type.
</Admonition>

### in

To listen to changes when a column's value in a table equals any client-specified values:

```js
const channel = supabase
  .channel('changes')
  .on(
    'postgres_changes',
    {
      event: 'INSERT',
      schema: 'public',
      table: 'colors',
      filter: 'name=in.(red, blue, yellow)',
    },
    (payload) => console.log(payload)
  )
  .subscribe()
```

<Admonition type="note">
  This filter uses Postgres' `= ANY`. Realtime allows a maximum of 100 values for this filter.
</Admonition>

## Combination changes

To listen to different events and schema/tables/filters combinations with the same channel:

```js
const channel = supabase
  .channel('db-changes')
  .on(
    'postgres_changes',
    {
      event: '*',
      schema: 'public',
      table: 'messages',
      filter: 'body=eq.bye',
    },
    (payload) => console.log(payload)
  )
  .on(
    'postgres_changes',
    {
      event: 'INSERT',
      schema: 'public',
      table: 'users',
    },
    (payload) => console.log(payload)
  )
  .subscribe()
```

## Full `old` record

By default, only `new` record changes are sent but if you want to receive the `old` record (previous values) whenever you `UPDATE` or `DELETE` a record, you can set the `replica identity` of your table to `full`:

```sql
alter table
  messages replica identity full;
```

<Admonition type="caution">

RLS policies are not applied to `DELETE` statements. When RLS is enabled and `replica identity` is set to `full` on a table, the `old` record contains only the primary key(s).

</Admonition>

## Private schemas

Postgres Changes works out of the box for tables in the `public` schema. You can listen to tables in your private schemas by granting table `SELECT` permissions to the database role found in your access token. You can run a query similar to the following:

```sql
grant select on "non_private_schema"."some_table" to authenticated;
```

<Admonition type="caution">

We strongly encourage you to enable RLS and create policies for tables in private schemas. Otherwise, any role you grant access to will have unfettered read access to the table.

</Admonition>

## Custom tokens

You may choose to sign your own tokens to customize claims that can be checked in your RLS policies.

Your project JWT secret is found with your [Project API keys](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/settings/api) in your dashboard.

<Admonition type="caution">
  Do not expose the `service_role` token on the client because the role is authorized to bypass
  row-level security.
</Admonition>

To use your own JWT with Realtime make sure to set the token after instantiating the Supabase client and before connecting to a Channel.

```js
const { createClient } = require('@supabase/supabase-js')

const supabase = createClient(process.env.SUPABASE_URL, process.env.SUPABASE_KEY, {})

// Set your custom JWT here
supabase.realtime.setAuth('your-custom-jwt')

const channel = supabase
  .channel('db-changes')
  .on(
    'postgres_changes',
    {
      event: '*',
      schema: 'public',
      table: 'messages',
      filter: 'body=eq.bye',
    },
    (payload) => console.log(payload)
  )
  .subscribe()
```

### Refreshed tokens

You will need to refresh tokens on your own, but once generated, you can pass them to Realtime.

For example, if you're using the `supabase-js` `v2` client then you can pass your token like this:

```js
// Client setup

supabase.realtime.setAuth('fresh-token')
```

## Limitations

The current version of Realtime's Postgres Changes feature has some performance limitations to keep in mind. There can be a bottleneck on the database that limits the number of messages streamed to subscribed clients.

The polling query that fetches the changes is currently single-threaded. If you are frequently changing your database, the polling query may not be able to fetch the changes rapidly enough. The delivery of the changes will be delayed until you will get timeout. Additionally, there is a polling query per subscribed client, which means that each unique pair of `filters` and `JWT token` (logged-in user) affects the performance of the polling query. In other words, RLS and filters can further limit the number of messages that can be streamed to subscribed clients.

From our testing and observation of the performance of the polling query, we have found that the following limits are safe to use:

| Database Add-on  | Filters | RLS Usage | Concurrent Clients | Records per second per client | Messages per second (total) | Latency p95 (ms) |

If you want to use Realtime's Postgres Changes feature you should be aware of these limitations. And if you are using this feature at scale, you should consider using separate table without RLS and filters for the purpose of streaming changes to subscribed clients. Alternatively, you can use Realtime server-side only and then re-stream the changes to your clients using a Realtime Broadcast. Don't forget to run your own benchmarks to make sure that the performance is acceptable for your use case.

We are making many improvements to Realtime's Postgres Changes.

If you are uncertain about the performance of your use case, please reach out using [Support Form](https://supabase.com/dashboard/support/new) and we will be happy to help you. We have a team of engineers that can advise you on the best solution for your use-case.
