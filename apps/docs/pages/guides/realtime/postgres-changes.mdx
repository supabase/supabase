}

Realtime's Postgres Changes feature listens for database changes and sends them to clients. Clients are required to subscribe with a JWT dictating which changes they are allowed to receive based on the database's [Row Level Security](/docs/guides/auth/row-level-security).

Anyone with access to a valid JWT signed with the project's JWT secret is able to listen to your database's changes, unless tables have [Row Level Security](/docs/guides/auth/row-level-security) enabled and policies in place.

Clients can choose to receive `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, or `*` (all) changes for all changes in a schema, a table in a schema, or a column's value in a table. Your clients should only listen to tables in the `public` schema and you must first enable the tables you want your clients to listen to.

Postgres Changes works out of the box for tables in the `public` schema. You can listen to tables in your private schemas by granting table `SELECT` permissions to the database role found in your access token. You can run a query similar to the following:

```sql
GRANT SELECT ON "private_schema"."table" TO authenticated;
```

<Admonition type="caution">
  We strongly encourage you to enable RLS and create policies for tables in private schemas.
  Otherwise, any role you grant access to will have unfettered read access to the table.
</Admonition>

## Replication Setup

You can do this in the [Replication](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/database/replication) section in the Dashboard or with the [SQL editor](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/sql):

```sql
begin;
  -- remove the supabase_realtime publication
  drop publication if exists supabase_realtime;

  -- re-create the supabase_realtime publication with no tables
  create publication supabase_realtime;
commit;

-- add a table to the publication
alter publication supabase_realtime add table messages;
```

### Full `old` Record

By default, only `new` record changes are sent but if you want to receive the `old` record (previous values) whenever you `UPDATE` or `DELETE` a record,
you can set the `replica identity` of your table to `full`:

```sql
alter table messages replica identity full;
```

## Schema Changes

To listen to all changes in the `public` schema:

```js
const { createClient } = require('@supabase/supabase-js')

const supabase = createClient(process.env.SUPABASE_URL, process.env.SUPABASE_KEY)

/*
  Channel name can be any string.
  Event name can can be one of:
    - INSERT
    - UPDATE
    - DELETE
    - *
*/
const channel = supabase
  .channel('schema-db-changes')
  .on(
    'postgres_changes',
    {
      event: '*',
      schema: 'public',
    },
    (payload) => console.log(payload)
  )
  .subscribe()
```

## Table Changes

To listen to changes on a table in the `public` schema:

```js
// Supabase client setup

const channel = supabase
  .channel('table-db-changes')
  .on(
    'postgres_changes',
    {
      event: 'INSERT',
      schema: 'public',
      table: 'messages',
    },
    (payload) => console.log(payload)
  )
  .subscribe()
```

## Filter Changes

To listen to changes when a column's value in a table matches a client-specified value:

```js
// Supabase client setup

const channel = supabase
  .channel('value-db-changes')
  .on(
    'postgres_changes',
    {
      event: 'UPDATE',
      schema: 'public',
      table: 'messages',
      filter: 'body=eq.hey',
    },
    (payload) => console.log(payload)
  )
  .subscribe()
```

## Combination Changes

To listen to different events and schema/tables/filters combinations with the same channel:

```js
// Supabase client setup

const channel = supabase
  .channel('db-changes')
  .on(
    'postgres_changes',
    {
      event: '*',
      schema: 'public',
      table: 'messages',
      filter: 'body=eq.bye',
    },
    (payload) => console.log(payload)
  )
  .on(
    'postgres_changes',
    {
      event: 'INSERT',
      schema: 'public',
      table: 'users',
    },
    (payload) => console.log(payload)
  )
  .subscribe()
```

## Custom Tokens

You may choose to sign your own tokens to customize claims that can be checked in your RLS policies.
In order for this to work you must pass `apikey` in both Realtime's `headers` and `params` when creating the client.

The `apikey` in `headers` must be either the `anon` or `service_role` token that Supabase signed.
This will authenticate your request in the API gateway.

<Admonition type="caution">
  Do not expose the `service_role` token on the client because the role is authorized to bypass
  row-level security.
</Admonition>

The `apikey` in `params` can be your custom token signed with the JWT secret of your Supabase project.
This is forwarded to the Realtime server and it will verify your custom token and use its claims to authorize database changes
when RLS is enabled.

```js
const { createClient } = require('@supabase/supabase-js')

const supabase = createClient(process.env.SUPABASE_URL, process.env.SUPABASE_KEY, {
  realtime: {
    headers: {
      apikey: 'supabase-signed-token',
    },
    params: {
      apikey: 'your-custom-token',
    },
  },
})
```
