Supabase Realtime is a global cluster. We've implemented some rate limits to help ensure high availability for all customers.

Rate limits are configurable per project and our cluster supports millions of concurrent connections. [Contact support](https://app.supabase.com/support/new) if these limits are causing issues.

## Limits by Plan

Limits are set on the Free and Pro plans accordingly. See our [pricing page](https://supabase.com/pricing) for more information.

Enterprise plans are billed on a usage basis. We still employ limiting on Enterprise plans. If you're on an Enterprise plan simply contact support and we'll increase your limits as needed.

Enterprise plan limits start at:

- 500 concurrent clients
- 1,000 messages per second
- 500 concurrent Channels

## System Limits

The following limits apply to all projects:

- 500 Channel joins per second
- 100 Channels per connected client

## Client-Side Limiting

Some basic WebSocket message rate limiting is implemented client-side.

For example, the [multiplayer.dev demo](/docs/guides/realtime/quickstart#cursor-positions) instantiates the Supabase client with an `eventsPerSecond` parameter.

## Rate Limiting Errors

Rate limiting errors can appear in backend logs and messages in the WebSocket connection.

Use the [Realtime Inspector](https://realtime.supabase.com/inspector/new) to reproduce an error and share those connection details with Supabase support.

### Backend Logs

If your project is being rate limited, check your [Realtime logs](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/database/realtime-logs).

### WebSocket Errors

- `tenant_events`: Clients will be disconnected if your project is generating too many messages per second. `supabase-js` should reconnect automatically when the message rate decreases below your plan limit.

Some limits can cause a Channel join to be refused. Realtime will reply with one of the following WebSocket messages:

- `too_many_channels`: Too many channels currently joined for a single client.
- `too_many_connections`: Too many total concurrent connections for a project.
- `too_many_joins`: Too many Channel joins per second.

<Admonition type="note">

Use your browser's developer tools to find the WebSocket initiation request and view individual messages.

## Payload Limits

Realtime has a message byte size limit of 1 megabyte.

## Presence Limits

Realtime Presence is a CRDT backed in-memory key value store based on Phoenix Presence. It's more expensive to update a Presence than Broadcast a message.

The following limits apply to Presence messages:

- 10 keys per object
- Message rate limit is 10% of your Realtime message rate limit
