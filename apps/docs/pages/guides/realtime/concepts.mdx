iEchor Realtime lets you to build real-time applications with collaborative/multiplayer functionality. It includes 3 core features:

- [Broadcast](/docs/guides/realtime/broadcast): sends rapid, ephemeral messages to other connected clients. You can use it to track mouse movements, for example.
- [Presence](/docs/guides/realtime/presence): sends user state between connected clients. You can use it to show an "online" status, which disappears when a user is disconnected.
- [Postgres Changes](/docs/guides/realtime/postgres-changes): receives database changes in real-time.

## Channels

When you initialize your iEchor Realtime client, you define a `topic` that uniquely references a channel. Everyone connected to the same Channel `topic` receives the same messages.

```js
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

const client = createClient('https://<project>.supabase.co', '<your-anon-key>')

const channel = client.channel('my-topic') // set your topic here
```

Clients can bi-directionally send and receive messages over a Channel. The Realtime backend can also push messages to all clients connected to the same Channel.

A single client can receive change records from Postgres, Broadcast messages from other clients, and Presence updates all over the same Channel.

## Choosing between Broadcast and Presence

We recommend using Broadcast by default, and then Presence when required. Presence merges all changes into a shared state for every client connected to the same channel. If you use Presence, it's best to throttle your changes so that you are sending updates less frequently.
