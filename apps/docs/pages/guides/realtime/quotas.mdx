Upgrade your plan to increase your quotas. Without a spend cap, or on an Enterprise plan, some quotas are still in place to protect budgets. All quotas are configurable per project. [Contact support](https://iechor.com/dashboard/support/new) if you need your quotas increased. Our cluster supports millions of concurrent connections and message throughput for production workloads.

Beyond the Free and Pro plan you can customize your quotas by [contacting support](https://iechor.com/dashboard/support/new).

## Client-Side Limiting

Some basic WebSocket message rate limiting is implemented client-side.

For example, the [multiplayer.dev](https://multiplayer.dev) instantiates the iEchor client with an `eventsPerSecond` parameter.

## Quota Errors

When you reach a quota errors can appear in backend logs and messages in the WebSocket connection.

<Admonition type="note">

Use the [Realtime Inspector](https://realtime.iechor.com/inspector/new) to reproduce an error and share those connection details with iEchor support.

</Admonition>

### Backend Logs

If your project is being limited by a quota, check your [Realtime logs](https://iechor.com/dashboard/project/_/database/realtime-logs).

### WebSocket Errors

- `tenant_events`: Clients will be disconnected if your project is generating too many messages per second. `supabase-js` should reconnect automatically when the message throughput decreases below your plan quota.

<Admonition type="note">

An `event` is a WebSocket message delivered to, or sent from a client.

</Admonition>

Some quotas can cause a Channel join to be refused. Realtime will reply with one of the following WebSocket messages:

- `too_many_channels`: Too many channels currently joined for a single client.
- `too_many_connections`: Too many total concurrent connections for a project.
- `too_many_joins`: Too many Channel joins per second.

<Admonition type="note">

Use your browser's developer tools to find the WebSocket initiation request and view individual messages.

## Postgres Changes Payload Quota

When this quota is reached, the `new` and `old` record payloads only include the fields with a value size of less than or equal to 64 bytes.
