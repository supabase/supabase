}

Broadcast follows the [publish-subscribe pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern) where a client publishes messages to a channel with a unique identifier. For example, a user could send a message to a channel with id `room-1`.

Other clients can elect to receive the message in real-time by subscribing to the channel with id `room-1`. If these clients are online and subscribed then they will receive the message.

Broadcast works by connecting your client to the nearest Realtime server, which will communicate with other servers to relay messages to other clients.

A common use-case is sharing a user's cursor position with other clients in an online game.

## Listen to Messages

You can get started with Broadcast by creating a client and listening to a channel's messages:

```js
const { createClient } = require('@supabase/supabase-js')

const supabase = createClient(process.env.SUPABASE_URL, process.env.SUPABASE_KEY)

supabase
  .channel('test')
  .on('broadcast', { event: 'supa' }, (payload) => console.log(payload))
  .subscribe()
```

## Send Messages

You can create another client and send messages to other clients:

```js
const { createClient } = require('@supabase/supabase-js')

const supabase = createClient(process.env.SUPABASE_URL, process.env.SUPABASE_KEY)

supabase.channel('test').subscribe((status) => {
  if (status === 'SUBSCRIBED') {
    channel.send({
      type: 'broadcast',
      event: 'supa',
      payload: { org: 'supabase' },
    })
  }
})
```

In order for clients to successfully send and receive mesages to one another, they must both specify the same `event`.

We recommend that the client has successfully subscribed to the channel prior to sending messages.

### Self-Send Messages

You can also choose for a client to receive messages that it sent:

```js
// Supabase client setup

supabase
  .channel('test', {
    config: {
      broadcast: {
        self: true,
      },
    },
  })
  .on('broadcast', { event: 'supa' }, (payload) => console.log(payload))
  .subscribe((status) => {
    if (status === 'SUBSCRIBED') {
      channel.send({
        type: 'broadcast',
        event: 'supa',
        payload: { org: 'supabase' },
      })
    }
  })
```

### Acknowledge Messages

You can ensure that Realtime's servers received your message by:

```js
// Supabase client setup

const channel = supabase.channel('receipt', {
  config: {
    broadcast: { ack: true },
  },
})

channel.subscribe(async (status) => {
  if (status === 'SUBSCRIBED') {
    const resp = await channel.send({
      type: 'broadcast',
      event: 'latency',
      payload: {},
    })
    console.log(resp)
  }
})
```

If `ack` is not set to `true`, Realtime servers will not acknowledge that it received the sent message and `send` promise resolves immediately.

## Client-Side Rate Limit

There is a default client-side rate limit that enables you to send 10 messages per second, or one message every 100 milliseconds. You can customize this when creating the client:

```js
const { createClient } = require('@supabase/supabase-js')

const supabase = createClient(
  process.env.SUPABASE_URL,
  process.env.SUPABASE_KEY,
  {
    realtime: {
      params: {
        eventsPerSecond: 20
      }
    }
  }
```

By setting `eventsPerSecond` to 20, you can send one message every 50 milliseconds on a per client basis.
