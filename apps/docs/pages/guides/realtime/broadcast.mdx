Let's explore how to implement Realtime Broadcast to send messages between clients.

## Usage

You can use the Supabase client libraries to send and receive Broadcast messages.

### Initialize the client

Go to your Supabase project's [API Settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/api) and grab the `URL` and `anon` public API key.

```js
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

const SUPABASE_URL = 'https://<project>.supabase.co'
const SUPABASE_KEY = '<your-anon-key>'

const client = createClient(SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_KEY)
```

### Listening to Broadcast messages

You can provide a callback for the `broadcast` channel to receive message. In this example we will receive any `broadcast` messages in `room-1`:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```js
// Join a room/topic. Can be anything except for 'realtime'.
const channelA = clientA.channel('room-1')

// Simple function to log any messages we receive
function messageReceived(payload) {
  console.log(payload) 
}

// Subscribe to the Channel
channelA
  .on(
    'broadcast', 
    { event: 'test' }, 
    (payload) => messageReceived(payload)
  )
  .subscribe()
```

### Sending Broadcast messages

We can send Broadcast messages using `channelB.send()`. Let's set up another client to send messages.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```js
// Join a room/topic. Can be anything except for 'realtime'.
const channelB = clientA.channel('room-1')

channelB.subscribe((status) => {
  // Wait for successful connection
  if (status !== 'SUBSCRIBED') {
    return null
  }

  // Send a message once the client is subscribed
  channelB.send({
    type: 'broadcast',
    event: 'test',
    payload: { message: 'hello, world' },
  })
})
```

Before sending messages we need to ensure the client is connected, which we have done within the `subscribe()` callback.

## Broadcast options

You can pass configuration options while initializing the Supabase Client.

### Self-send messages

By default, broadcast messages are only sent to other clients. You can broadcast messages back to the sender by setting Broadcast's `self` parameter to `true`.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```js
const myChannel = supabase.channel('room-2', {
  config: {
    broadcast: { self: true },
  },
})

myChannel.on(
  'broadcast', 
  { event: 'test-my-messages' }, 
  (payload) => console.log(payload)
)

myChannel.subscribe((status) => {
  if (status !== 'SUBSCRIBED') { return }
  channelC.send({
    type: 'broadcast',
    event: 'test-my-messages',
    payload: { message: 'talking to myself' },
  })
})
```

### Acknowledge messages

You can confirm that Realtime received your message by setting Broadcast's `ack` config to `true`.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```js
const myChannel = clientD.channel('room-3', {
  config: {
    broadcast: { ack: true },
  },
})

myChannel.subscribe(async (status) => {
  if (status !== 'SUBSCRIBED') { return }

  const serverResponse = await myChannel.send({
    type: 'broadcast',
    event: 'acknowledge',
    payload: {},
  })

  console.log('serverResponse', serverResponse)
})
```

Use this to guarantee that the server has received the message before resolving `channelD.send`'s promise. If the `ack` config is not set to `true` when creating the channel, the promise returned by `channelD.send` will resolve immediately.
