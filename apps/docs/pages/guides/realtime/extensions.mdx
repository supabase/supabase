}

Extensions are pluggable feature sets enabled by initializing a Realtime connection with certain message types.

[Broadcast](/docs/guides/realtime/broadcast), [Presence](/docs/guides/realtime/presence) and [Postgres Changes](/docs/guides/realtime/postgres-changes) are all Realtime Extensions. Some Extensions, like Postgres Changes, require backend configuration to be saved on the cluster before use.

For example, Realtime needs your database credentials to know how to connect to your database and you don't want to send those over a client connection.
