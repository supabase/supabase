Supabase Realtime provides multiplayer features so that you can build real-time applications. The server has several built-in extensions to solve specific tasks.

- [Broadcast](/docs/guides/realtime/broadcast): for sending rapid, ephemeral messages to other connected clients. A typical use-case is tracking mouse movements.
- [Presence](/docs/guides/realtime/presence): for sending user state between connected clients. A typical use-case is simply an "online" status, which will disappear when a user is disconnected.
- [Postgres Changes](/docs/guides/realtime/postgres-changes): for receiving database changes in real-time.

## Choosing between Broadcast and Presence

Defaulting to using Broadcast is a good idea, and then use Presence sparingly. The Presence extension merges all changes into a shared state for every client connected to the same "channel". If you _do_ use Presence, it's best to throttle your changes so that you are sending updates less frequently.

## Future possibilities

Realtime extensions are still under development. We have many more extensions planned. You can follow our progress by watching the [Realtime](https://github.com/supabase/realtime) repo on GitHub.
