You can uniquely reference a channel by its `topic` you define when you initialize your Supabase Realtime client. Everyone connected to the same Channel topic will receive the same messages.

Clients can send and receive messages bi-directionally over a Channel. The Realtime backend can also push messages to all clients connected to the same Channel.

A single client can receive change records from Postgres, Broadcast messages from other clients and Presence updates all over the same Channel.

Channels are implemented over [Phoenix Channels](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/channels.html) which uses [Phoenix.PubSub](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_pubsub/Phoenix.PubSub.html) with the default `Phoenix.PubSub.PG2` adapter.

The PG2 adapter utilizes Erlang [process groups](https://www.erlang.org/docs/18/man/pg2.html) to implement the PubSub model where a publisher can send messages to many subscribers.
