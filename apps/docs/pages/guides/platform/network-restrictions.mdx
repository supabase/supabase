Network Restrictions is currently in beta and is slowly being made available to all projects. [Contact support](https://supabase.com/dashboard/support/new) if you'd like to request early access.

</Admonition>

Each Supabase project comes with configurable restrictions on the IP ranges that are allowed to connect to Postgres and its pooler ("your database"). These restrictions are enforced before traffic reaches your database. If a connection is not restricted by IP, it still needs to authenticate successfully with valid database credentials.

To get started:

1. [Install](/docs/guides/cli) the Supabase CLI 1.22.0+.
1. [Log in](/docs/guides/getting-started/local-development#log-in-to-the-supabase-cli) to your Supabase account using the CLI.
1. If your project was created before 23rd December 2022, it will need to be [upgraded to the latest Supabase version](/docs/guides/platform/migrating-and-upgrading-projects) before Network Restrictions can be used.
1. Ensure that you have [Owner or Admin permissions](/docs/guides/platform/access-control#manage-team-members) for the project that you are enabling network restrictions.

## Check restrictions

You can use the `get` subcommand of the CLI to retrieve the restrictions currently in effect.

If restrictions have been applied, the output of the `get` command will reflect the IP ranges allowed to connect:

```bash
> supabase network-restrictions --project-ref {ref} get --experimental
DB Allowed CIDRs: [128.12.1.1/16 183.12.1.1/24]
Restrictions applied successfully: true
```

If restrictions have never been applied to your project, the list of allowed CIDRs will be empty, but they will also not have been applied ("Restrictions applied successfully: false"). As a result, all IPs are allowed to connect to your database:

```bash
> supabase network-restrictions --project-ref {ref} get --experimental
DB Allowed CIDRs: []
Restrictions applied successfully: false
```

## Update restrictions

The `update` subcommand is used to apply network restrictions to your project:

```bash
> supabase network-restrictions --project-ref {ref} update --db-allow-cidr 128.12.1.1/16 --db-allow-cidr 183.12.1.1/24 --experimental
DB Allowed CIDRs: [128.12.1.1/16 183.12.1.1/24]
Restrictions applied successfully: true
```

The restrictions specified (in the form of CIDRs) replaces any restrictions that might have been applied in the past.
To add to the existing restrictions, you must include the existing restrictions within the list of CIDRs provided to the `update` command.

## Remove restrictions

To remove all restrictions on your project, you can use the `update` subcommand with the CIDR `0.0.0.0/0`:

```bash
> supabase network-restrictions --project-ref {ref} update --db-allow-cidr 0.0.0.0/0 --experimental
DB Allowed CIDRs: [0.0.0.0/0]
Restrictions applied successfully: true
```

## Limitations

- The current iteration of Network Restrictions applies to connections to Postgres and the database pooler; it doesn't currently apply to APIs offered over HTTPS (e.g., PostgREST, Storage, and Auth). This includes using Supabase client libraries like [supabase-js](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript).
- Network Restrictions should not be used if you need to connect to your Postgres database using Edge Functions.
- [Supavisor](https://github.com/supabase/supavisor/) does not currently support Network Restrictions.
