Supabase provides granular access control features that let you manage permissions across your organizations.

Within a Supabase organization, a member can have one of the following roles:

- Owner
- Administrator
- Developer

A default organization is created for a user when they first sign-in and
assigned the **Owner** role. If the user wants to invite others
to collaborate within the organization, they can visit the organization team
settings (`https://app.supabase.com/org/<org-slug>/settings#team`) to send an
invite link to another user's email. The invite expires after 24 hours.

Invites sent from a SSO account can only be accepted by another SSO account
coming from the same identity provider. This is a security measure that
prevents accidental invites to accounts not managed by your company's
enterprise systems.

Project level invites are not available at this time. A member of the
organization will be able to access all projects under the organization. If you
wish to restrict access to certain projects, please create another organization
to manage this.

## Manage team members

You can invite your team members into your organizations to collaborate on projects.

### Transferring ownership of an organization

An organization can have multiple owners, so a Supabase organization can either have 1 owner, or several owners.

If you would like to no longer be an owner of an organization you can simply click 'Leave team' in the members view (`https://app.supabase.com/org/<org-slug>/settings#team`) of your organization.
However, you can only leave an organization when there is _at least 1 other owner_.

If you are transferring ownership of your organization to someone else, then you will need to invite the new member with the role `"Owner"`. Once they've accepted the invitation, you can then leave your organization.

### Permissions across roles [#permission-across-roles]
