Supabase provides granular access controls to manage permissions across your organizations.
For each organization, a member can have one of the following roles:

- Owner
- Administrator
- Developer

A default organization is created when you first sign in and
you'll be assigned the **Owner** role.
Each member can access all projects under the organization.
Project level invites are not available at this time.
Create a separate organization if you need to restrict access to certain projects.

## Manage team members

To invite others to collaborate, visit your organization's team settings in the
[Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com/projects) to send an invite link to
another user's email. The invite expires after 24 hours.

### Transferring ownership of an organization

Each Supabase organization can have one or more owners. If you no longer want be an owner of an organization, click **Leave team** in the members view (`https://app.supabase.com/org/<org-slug>/settings#team`) of your organization.
However, you can only leave an organization when there is _at least one other owner_.

If you are transferring ownership of your organization to someone else, you will need to invite the new member with the **Owner** role. You can leave the organization after they've accepted the invitation.

### Permissions across roles [#permission-across-roles]

The table below shows the corresponding permissions for each available role you can assign a team member in the Dashboard.
