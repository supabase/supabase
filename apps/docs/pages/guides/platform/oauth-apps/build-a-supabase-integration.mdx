## Overview

This guide steps through building a Supabase Integration using OAuth2 and the management API, allowing you to manage users' organizations and projects on their behalf.

Using OAuth2.0 you can retrieve an access and refresh token that grant your application full access to the [Management API](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/api/introduction) on behalf of the user.

## Create an OAuth App

1. In your organization's settings, navigate to the [**OAuth Apps**](/dashboard/org/_/apps) tab.
2. In the upper-right section of the page, click **Add application**.
3. Fill in the required details and click **Confirm**.

## Show a "Connect Supabase" button

In your backend, add a "Connect Supabase" button to kick off the OAuth2 flow utilizing the following design language.

// TODO add design guidelines

## Implement the OAuth 2.0 flow

Once you've published your OAuth App on Supabase, you can use the OAuth 2.0 protocol get authorization from Supabase users to manage their organizations and projects.

You can use your preferred OAuth2 client or follow the steps below. You can see an example implementation in TypeScript using Supabase Edge Functions [on our GitHub](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/tree/master/examples/edge-functions/supabase/functions/connect-supabase).

1. Within your app's UI, redirect the user to [`https://api.supabase.com/v1/oauth/authorize`](<https://api.supabase.com/api/v1#/oauth%20(beta)/authorize>). Make sure to include all required query parameters such as:
   - `client_id` A UUID uniquely identifying your OAuth app in Supabase.
   - `redirect_uri` The URL where Supabase will redirect the user after providing consent.
   - `scope` The only scope supported is `all`. Scoped access is not available at this time.
   - `response_type` The value `code`.
   - `state` Information about the state of your app. Note that `redirect_uri` and `state` cannot both exceed 4kB in size.
   - We strongly recommend using the PKCE flow for increased security. Generate a random value before taking the user to the authorize endpoint. This value is called code verifier. Hash it with SHA256 and include it as the `code_challenge` parameter, while setting `code_challenge_method` to `S256`. In the next step, you would need to provide the code verifier to get the first access and refresh token.
2. Once the user consents to providing API access to your OAuth App, Supabase will redirect the user to the `redirect_uri` endpoint you provided in the previous step. The URL will contain these query parameters:
   - `code` An authorization code you should exchange with Supabase to get the access and refresh token.
   - `state` The value you provided in the previous step, to help you associate the request with the user. The `state` property returned here should be compared to the `state` you sent previously.
3. Exchange the authorization code for an access and refresh token by calling `POST https://api.supabase.com/v1/oauth/token` and including the following query parameters:
   - `grant_type` The value `authorization_code`.
   - `code` The `code` returned in the previous step.
   - `client_id` The unique client ID identifying your OAuth App.
   - `client_secret` The secret that authenticates your OAuth App to Supabase.
   - `redirect_uri` This must be exactly the same URL used in the first step.
   - If you used the PKCE flow in the first step, include the code verifier as `code_verifier`.

## Refresh an access token

You can use the [`POST /v1/oauth/token`](<https://api.supabase.com/api/v1#/oauth%20(beta)/token>) endpoint to refresh an access token using the refresh token returned at the end of the previous section.

If the user has revoked access to your application, you will not be able to refresh a token. Furthermore, access tokens will stop working. Make sure you handle HTTP Unauthorized errors when calling any Supabase API.

## Access the Management API using the access token

Refer to [the Management API reference](/docs/reference/api/introduction#authentication) to learn more about authentication with the Management API.

### Use the JavaScript (TypeScript) SDK

For convenience, when working with JavaScript/TypeScript, you can use the [supabase-management-js](https://github.com/supabase-community/supabase-management-js#supabase-management-js) library.

## Intergation Options

There are a couple common patterns we recommend adding to your integration that can facilitate a great user experience.

### Store API keys in env variables

### Pre-fill database connection details

### Create a new project

### Configure custom Auth SMTP

You can configure the user's [custom SMTP settings](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-smtp) using the [`/config/auth` endpoint](https://api.supabase.com/api/v1#/projects%20config/updateV1AuthConfig).

## Current limitations

- No scopes support yet. Scoped (e.g. read-only) access will be supported in the future.
- We don't return database passwords via the API.
