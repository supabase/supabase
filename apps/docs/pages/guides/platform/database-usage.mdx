Database size refers to the _monthly average storage usage_, as reported by Postgres. This metric is reported in your project's [billing usage](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/settings/billing/usage) and is updated daily.
Database size is the total size of used storage from your database, whereas disk size describes the size of the underlying available storage.

For an instantaneous live view of the DB size, you can execute in Postgres:

```sql
select
  sum(pg_database_size (pg_database.datname)) / (1024 * 1024) as db_size_mb
from
  pg_database;
```

This value is also reported in the [database settings page](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/settings/database).

## Database storage management

Supabase uses network-attached storage to balance performance with scalability.
For Pro and Enterprise projects, disk size expands ~1.5x automatically (e.g., 8GB -> 12GB) when you reach 90% of the disk size.
Automatic disk size expansion can only occur once every six hours.
Pro projects can store up to 1024TB.

All projects enter read-only mode when you reach 95% of the disk size. In read-only mode, clients will encounter errors such as `cannot execute INSERT in a read-only transaction`.
Regular operation (read-write mode) is automatically re-enabled once usage is below 95% of the disk size.

If you need more than 1024TB of disk size or require multiple storage expansions in a short period of time, [contact us](https://app.supabase.com/support/new) to learn more about the Enterprise plan.

### Increasing available disk size

1. [Upgrade to the Pro or Enterprise plan](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/settings/billing/subscription) to increase your quota and expand your disk size automatically.

2. Delete data from your project's database to lower its disk usage. If your database is already in read-only mode, run the following command to change the transaction mode to read-write for your session:

   ```sql
   SET
     default_transaction_read_only = 'off';
   ```

   This allows you to delete data from within the session.

### Preoccupied Space

When launching a new project, your database size will be roughly ~40-60mb.
The space is used up by preinstalled extensions, schema/data used by our services that are offered with each project and default Postgres data.

When installing additional extensions, even if you don't actively use them, additional database size is used.

## Vacuum operations

Postgres does not immediately reclaim the physical space used by dead tuples (i.e., deleted rows) in the DB. Instead, they are internally marked as removed until a [vacuum operation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/routine-vacuuming.html) is executed.
As a result, deleting data from your database may not immediately reduce the reported disk usage.

<Admonition type="note">

Vacuum operations can temporarily increase resource utilization, which may adversely impact the observed performance of your project until the maintenance is completed.

</Admonition>

Supabase projects have automatic vacuuming enabled, which ensures that these operations are performed regularly to keep the database healthy and performant.
However, it can be necessary to either [fine-tune](https://www.percona.com/blog/2018/08/10/tuning-autovacuum-in-postgresql-and-autovacuum-internals/)
the [autovacuum parameters](https://www.enterprisedb.com/blog/postgresql-vacuum-and-analyze-best-practice-tips),
or [manually initiate](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-vacuum.html) vacuum operations.
For example, running a manual vacuum after deleting large amounts of data from your DB could help reduce the reported disk usage by Postgres.
