<Admonition type="note">

Postgres SSL Enforcement is currently in beta and is slowly being made available to all projects. [Contact support](https://app.supabase.com/support/new) if you'd like to request early access.

</Admonition>

Your Supabase project supports connecting to the Postgres DB without SSL enabled to maximize client compatibility. For increased security, you can prevent clients from connecting if they're not using SSL.

SSL enforcement only applies to connections to both Postgres and PgBouncer ("Connection Pooler"); all HTTP APIs offered by Supabase (e.g., PostgREST, Storage, Auth) automatically enforce SSL on all incoming connections.

To get started:

1. [Install](/docs/guides/cli) the Supabase CLI 1.37.0+.
1. [Log in](/docs/guides/cli/local-development#log-in-to-the-supabase-cli) to your Supabase account using the CLI.
1. Ensure that you have [Owner or Admin permissions](/docs/guides/platform/access-control#manage-team-members) for the project that you are enabling SSL enforcement.

## Check enforcement status

You can use the `get` subcommand of the CLI to check whether SSL is currently being enforced:

```bash
> supabase ssl-enforcement --project-ref {ref} get --experimental
SSL is being enforced.
```

Or similarly, if SSL is not being enforced, you will see:

```bash
> supabase ssl-enforcement --project-ref {ref} get --experimental
SSL is *NOT* being enforced.
```

## Update enforcement

The `update` subcommand is used to change the SSL enforcement status for your project:

```bash
> supabase ssl-enforcement --project-ref {ref} update --enable-db-ssl-enforcement --experimental
SSL is now being enforced.
```

Similarly, to disable SSL enforcement:

```bash
> supabase ssl-enforcement --project-ref {ref} update --disable-db-ssl-enforcement --experimental
SSL is *NOT* being enforced.
```
