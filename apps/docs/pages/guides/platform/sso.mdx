Supabase offers single sign-on (SSO) as a login option to provide additional
account security for your team. This allows company administrators to enforce
the use of an identity provider when logging into Supabase. SSO
improves the onboarding and offboarding experience of the company as the
employee only needs a single set of credentials to access third-party
applications or toolsâ€”which can also be revoked easily by an administrator.

<Admonition type="note">

Supabase currently provides SAML SSO. Please contact [Enterprise
Sales](https://supabase.com/contact/enterprise) to have this enabled for your
organization.

## Understanding setup and implications

Accounts signing in with SSO have certain limitations.
The following sections outline the limitations when SSO is enabled or disabled for your team.

### Enable SSO for your team [#enable-sso]

- Organization invites are restricted to members of the company that belong to
  the same identity provider.
- Every user has an organization created by default. They can create as many
  projects as they want.
- An SSO user will not be able to update their password or reset their
  password since their access is managed by the company administrator via the
  identity provider.
- If an SSO user with the following email of `alice@foocorp.com` attempts to
  sign-in with a GitHub account that uses the same email, a separate Supabase
  account is created and will not be linked to the SSO user's account.
- An SSO user will not be able to see all organizations / projects created
  under the same identity provider. They will need to be invited to the
  Supabase organization first. Refer to [access control](/docs/guides/platform/access-control)
  for more information.

### Disable SSO for your team [#disable-sso]

- You can prevent a user's account from further access to Supabase by removing
  or disabling their account in your identity provider.
- You should also remove or downgrade their permissions from any organizations
  inside Supabase.
