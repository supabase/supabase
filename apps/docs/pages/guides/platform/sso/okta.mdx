Supabase supports single sign-on (SSO) using Okta.

## Step 1: Choose Create App Integration in the Applications dashboard [#create-app-integration]

Navigate to the Applications dashboard of the Okta admin console. Choose the
_Create App Integration_ button from the toolbar.

button](/docs/img/sso-okta-step-01.png)

## Step 2: Choose SAML 2.0 in the app integration dialog [#create-saml-app]

Supabase supports the SAML 2.0 SSO protocol. Choose it from the _Create a new
app integration_ dialog.

## Step 3: Fill out General Settings [#add-general-settings]

The information you enter here is for visibility into your Okta applications
menu. You can choose any values you like. `Supabase` as a name works well for
most use cases.

## Step 4: Fill out SAML Settings [#add-saml-settings]

These settings let Supabase use SAML 2.0 properly with your Okta application.
Make sure you enter this information exactly as shown on in this table and
screenshot.

| Setting                                        | Value                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Single sign-on URL                             | `https://supabase.com/dashboard/auth/v1/sso/saml/acs`      |
| Use this for Recipient URL and Destination URL | ✔️                                                         |
| Audience URI (SP Entity ID)                    | `https://supabase.com/dashboard/auth/v1/sso/saml/metadata` |
| Default RelayState                             | `https://supabase.com/dashboard`                           |
| Name ID format                                 | EmailAddress                                               |

wizard, Configure SAML step](/docs/img/sso-okta-step-04.png)

## Step 5: Fill out Attribute Statements [#add-attribute-statements]

Attribute Statements allow Supabase to get information about your Okta users on each login.

**A `email` to `user.email` statement is required to exist.** Other mappings
shown below are optional and configurable depending on your Okta
setup. If in doubt, replicate the same config as shown.

Please share any changes, if any, from this screen with your Supabase support
contact.

screen](/docs/img/sso-okta-step-05.png)

## Step 6: Obtain IdP metadata URL [#idp-metadata-url]

Supabase needs to finalize enabling single sign-on with your Okta
application.

To do this scroll down to the _SAML Signing Certificates_ section on the _Sign
On_ tab of the _Supabase_ application. Pick the the _SHA-2_ row with an
_Active_ status. Click on the _Actions_ dropdown button and then on the _View
IdP Metadata_.

This will open up the SAML 2.0 Metadata XML file in a new tab in your browser.
Copy this URL and send it to your support contact and await further
instructions. If you're not clear who to send this link to or need further
assistance, please reach out to
[support@supabase.com](mailto:support@supabase.com).

The link usually has this structure: `https://<okta-org>.okta.com/apps/<app-id>/sso/saml/metadata`

![Okta dashboard: SAML Signing Certificates, Actions button highlighted](/docs/img/sso-okta-step-06.png)

## Step 7: Wait for confirmation [#confirmation]

Once you’ve configured the Okta app as shown above, make sure you send the
[metadata URL](#idp-metadata-url) and information regarding the
[attribute statements](#add-attribute-statements) (if any changes are applicable) to
your support contact at Supabase.

Wait for confirmation that this information has successfully been added to
Supabase. It usually takes us 1 business day to configure this information
for you.

## Step 8: Test single sign-on [#testing]

Once you’ve received confirmation from your support contact at Supabase that
SSO setup has been completed for your enterprise, you can ask some of your
users to sign in via their Okta account.

You ask them to enter their email address on the [Sign in with
SSO](https://supabase.com/dashboard/sign-in-sso) page.

If sign in is not working correctly, please reach out to your support contact
at Supabase for further guidance.
