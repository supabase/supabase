Supabase ships fast and we endeavor to add all new features to existing projects wherever possible.
In some cases, access to new features require upgrading or migrating your Supabase project.

## Upgrade your project

<Admonition type="note">
  This is only available for projects on the Free plan. For projects on the Pro plan, please contact
  support for assistance with upgrading.
</Admonition>

When you pause and restore a project, the restored database includes the latest features. This method _does_ include downtime, so be aware that your project will be inaccessible for a short period of time.

1. On the [General Settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/general) page in the Dashboard, click **Pause project**. You will be redirected to the home screen as your project is pausing. This process can take several minutes.
1. After your project is paused, click **Restore project**. The restoration can take several minutes depending on how much data your database has. You will receive an email once the restoration is complete.

## Migrate your project

Migrating projects can be achieved using the Supabase CLI. This is particularly useful for older projects (e.g. to use a newer Postgres version).

### Before you begin

- Install [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) so you can run `psql` and `pg_dump`.
- Install [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli#installation).
- Create a new [Supabase project](https://supabase.com/dashboard).
- Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com) for your platform.
- Set environment variables for the old project's database URL as `$OLD_DB_URL` and the new project's as `$NEW_DB_URL`.
  To find the database URL for a project, go to the project's dashboard page [Project Settings/Database](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/database) and look at `Connection string / URI`. For example, to set the `$OLD_DB_URL` you would run `export OLD_DB_URL=postgresql://postgres:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@db.[YOUR-PROJECT-REF#].supabase.co:5432/postgres`.

### Backup your old database

1. Run the following command from your terminal:

```bash
supabase db dump --db-url "$OLD_DB_URL" -f roles.sql --role-only
supabase db dump --db-url "$OLD_DB_URL" -f schema.sql
supabase db dump --db-url "$OLD_DB_URL" -f data.sql --use-copy --data-only
```

### Restore to your new project

In your new project:

1. Enable [Database Webhooks](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/database/hooks) if you enabled them in your old project.
2. Enable any [extensions](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/database/extensions) that were enabled in your old project.

Then run the following command from your terminal:

```bash
psql \
  --single-transaction \
  --variable ON_ERROR_STOP=1 \
  --file roles.sql \
  --file schema.sql \
  --file data.sql \
  --dbname "$NEW_DB_URL"
```

Notes:

- If you have created any [custom roles](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/database/roles) with `login` attribute, you have to manually set their passwords in the new project.
- If you receive any permission errors when running `supabase db dump --db-url "$OLD_DB_URL" -f schema.sql`, you may need to edit the `schema.sql` file and change any lines saying `OWNER TO "supabase_admin"` to `OWNER TO "postgres"`.

### Enable publication on tables

Replication for Realtime is disabled for all tables in your new project. On the [Replication](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/database/replication) page in the Dashboard, select your new project and enable replication for tables that were enabled in your old project.

### Migrate Storage objects

The new project has the old project's Storage buckets, but the Storage objects need to be migrated manually. Use this script to move storage objects from one project to another.

```js
// npm install @supabase/supabase-js@1
const { createClient } = require('@supabase/supabase-js')

const OLD_PROJECT_URL = 'https://xxx.supabase.co'
const OLD_PROJECT_SERVICE_KEY = 'old-project-service-key-xxx'

const NEW_PROJECT_URL = 'https://yyy.supabase.co'
const NEW_PROJECT_SERVICE_KEY = 'new-project-service-key-yyy'

;(async () => {
  const oldSupabaseRestClient = createClient(OLD_PROJECT_URL, OLD_PROJECT_SERVICE_KEY, {
    db: {
      schema: 'storage',
    },
  })
  const oldSupabaseClient = createClient(OLD_PROJECT_URL, OLD_PROJECT_SERVICE_KEY)
  const newSupabaseClient = createClient(NEW_PROJECT_URL, NEW_PROJECT_SERVICE_KEY)

  // make sure you update max_rows in postgrest settings if you have a lot of objects
  // or paginate here
  const { data: oldObjects, error } = await oldSupabaseRestClient.from('objects').select()
  if (error) {
    console.log('error getting objects from old bucket')
    throw error
  }

  for (const objectData of oldObjects) {
    console.log(`moving ${objectData.id}`)
    try {
      const { data, error: downloadObjectError } = await oldSupabaseClient.storage
        .from(objectData.bucket_id)
        .download(objectData.name)
      if (downloadObjectError) {
        throw downloadObjectError
      }

      const { _, error: uploadObjectError } = await newSupabaseClient.storage
        .from(objectData.bucket_id)
        .upload(objectData.name, data, {
          upsert: true,
          contentType: objectData.metadata.mimetype,
          cacheControl: objectData.metadata.cacheControl,
        })
      if (uploadObjectError) {
        throw uploadObjectError
      }
    } catch (err) {
      console.log('error moving ', objectData)
      console.log(err)
    }
  }
})()
```
