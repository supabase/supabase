<Admonition type="note">

Custom Domains are currently in beta, and are being slowly made available to projects.

</Admonition>

Custom domains allow you to present a branded experience to your users. Custom domains are available as a [add-on for projects on a paid tier](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/settings/billing/update). Setting up a custom domain requires [Owner or Admin permissions](/docs/guides/platform/access-control#manage-team-members) for the project. Currently, you must use a subdomain (e.g., `api.example.com`, rather than `example.com`) for the purposes of this guide.

## Configure a Custom Domain using the Supabase Dashboard

Follow the **Custom Domains** steps in the [General Settings](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/settings/general) page in the Dashboard to set up a custom domain for your project.

## Configure a Custom Domain using the Supabase CLI

This example assumes your Supabase project is `foobarbaz` with a corresponding API URL `foobarbaz.supabase.co` and configures a custom domain at `api.example.com`.

To get started:

1. [Install](/docs/guides/resources/supabase-cli) the Supabase CLI 1.11.3+.
1. [Log in](/docs/guides/resources/supabase-cli/local-development#log-in-to-the-supabase-cli) to your Supabase account using the CLI.

### Configure a CNAME

Set up a CNAME record for `api.example.com`, resolving to `foobarbaz.supabase.co.`, with as low a TTL as possible.

### Configure TXT Verification

Use the `create` subcommand of the CLI to notify Supabase of your domain and retrieve TXT verification records:

```bash
supabase domains create --project-ref foobarbaz --custom-hostname api.example.com --experimental
```

The output of the `create` command includes two TXT records[^1] you will need to set up, in order to verify your control over the domain in question,
and for us to issue SSL certificates for it. For example:

```bash
[...]
Required outstanding validation records:
        _cf-custom-hostname.api.example.com TXT -> 46BBC14D-D50A-409C-8DB5-F862CF5BA660
        api.example.com TXT -> ca3-F1HvR9i938OgVwpCFwi1jTsbhe1hvT0Ic3efPY3Q
```

[^1] One of the records requires you to _replace_ the CNAME record set up in [the first step](#configure-a-cname) with a TXT record. You'll be able to restore it back to the CNAME after the verification process has been completed.

### Verify your domain

Set up both records as instructed, and then use the `reverify` command for the Supabase Platform to verify the records:

```bash
supabase domains reverify --project-ref foobarbaz --experimental
```

You might need to wait a few minutes before your updated DNS records are propagated, especially if the older records were using a high TTL.

### Activate your domain

The final activation step reconfigures your project to start serving traffic on your custom domain (`api.example.com`).
The auth service, in particular, will no longer work with the original URL (`foobarbaz.supabase.co`).
As such, it is recommended that you schedule a downtime window of 20-30 minutes, depending on the complexity of your project, to update all the services that need to know about your custom domain:

- any client code (e.g., frontends, mobile apps)
- any OAuth providers (e.g., google, github)

Additionally, update the DNS configuration for `api.example.com` to once more use a CNAME record that resolves to `foobarbaz.supabase.co`.
Finally, you can use the `activate` subcommand to reconfigure your project:

```bash
supabase domains activate --project-ref foobarbaz --experimental
```

## Remove a Custom Domain

If you have a custom domain (`api.example.com`) set up for your Supabase project (ref `foobarbaz`, with assigned endpoints at `foobarbaz.supabase.co`), and would like to go back to using the Supabase-provisioned endpoints (`foobarbaz.supabase.co`), you can use the `delete` subcommand:

```bash
supabase domains delete --project-ref foobarbaz --experimental
```

As with the final activation stage of the process for setting up a custom domain, you'll need to update any references in your client code and OAuth providers from the custom domain to the Supabase-provisioned endpoints.

## Vanity Subdomains

<Admonition type="note">

Vanity Subdomains are currently in beta, and are being slowly made available to projects. [Contact Support](https://app.supabase.com/support/new) if you'd like to request early access.

</Admonition>

Vanity Subdomains allow you to present a basic branded experience, compared to custom domains. They allow you to host your services at a custom subdomain on Supabase (e.g., `my-example-brand.supabase.co`) instead of the default, randomly-assigned `foobarbaz.supabase.co`.

To get started:

1. [Install](/docs/guides/resources/supabase-cli) the Supabase CLI 1.22.0+.
1. [Log in](/docs/guides/resources/supabase-cli/local-development#log-in-to-the-supabase-cli) to your Supabase account using the CLI.
1. Ensure that you have [Owner or Admin permissions](/docs/guides/platform/access-control#manage-team-members) for the project you'd like to set up a vanity subdomain for.
1. Ensure that your project has a paid subscription (Pro/Pay as you go/Enterprise tier) in the [Billing page of the Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/settings/billing/subscription).

## Configure a Vanity Subdomain

This example assumes your Supabase project is `foobarbaz` with a corresponding API URL `foobarbaz.supabase.co` and configures a vanity subdomain at `my-example-brand.supabase.co`.

### Check subdomain availability

Use the `check-availability` subcommand of the CLI to check if your desired subdomain is available for use:

```bash
supabase vanity-subdomains --project-ref foobarbaz check-availability --desired-subdomain my-example-brand --experimental
```

### Activate a subdomain

Once you've chosen an available subdomain, you can reconfigure your Supabase project to start serving traffic on the vanity subdomain (`my-example-brand.supabase.co`).
The auth service, in particular, will no longer work with the original URL (`foobarbaz.supabase.co`).
As such, it is recommended that you schedule a downtime window of 20-30 minutes, depending on the complexity of your project, to update all the services that need to know about your vanity subdomain:

- any client code (e.g., frontends, mobile apps)
- any OAuth providers (e.g., Google, GitHub)

The `activate` subcommand can be used to initiate the activation:

```bash
supabase vanity-subdomains --project-ref fwmssjhjgszhnavvqxnt check-availability --desired-subdomain my-example-subdomain --experimental
```

## Remove a Vanity Subdomain

If you have a vanity subdomain (`my-example-brand.supabase.co`) set up for your Supabase project (ref `foobarbaz`, with assigned endpoints at `foobarbaz.supabase.co`), and would like to go back to using the Supabase-provisioned endpoints (`foobarbaz.supabase.co`), you can use the `delete` subcommand:

```bash
supabase vanity-subdomains delete --project-ref foobarbaz --experimental
```

As with the final activation stage of the process for setting up a vanity subdomain, you'll need to update any references in your client code and OAuth providers from the vanity subdomain to the Supabase-provisioned endpoints.

## Limitations

- Edge functions do not honor the custom domain or the vanity subdomain setting and they still have to be invoked via the `foobarbaz.supabase.co` domain.
- A Supabase project can—at this time—use either a Custom Domain or a Vanity Subdomain, but not both.
