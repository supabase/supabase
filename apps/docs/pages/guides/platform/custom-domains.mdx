Custom domains allow you to present a branded experience to your users. Custom domains are available as a [add-on for projects on a paid plan](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/addons?panel=customDomain). Setting up a custom domain requires [Owner or Admin permissions](/docs/guides/platform/access-control#manage-team-members) for the project. Currently, you must use a subdomain (e.g., `api.example.com`, rather than `example.com`) for the purposes of this guide.

## Configure a Custom Domain using the Supabase Dashboard

Follow the **Custom Domains** steps in the [General Settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/general) page in the Dashboard to set up a custom domain for your project.

## Configure a Custom Domain using the Supabase CLI

This example assumes your Supabase project is `foobarbaz` with a corresponding API URL `foobarbaz.supabase.co` and configures a custom domain at `api.example.com`.

To get started:

1. [Install](/docs/guides/resources/supabase-cli) the Supabase CLI 1.11.3+.
1. [Log in](/docs/guides/resources/supabase-getting-started/local-development#log-in-to-the-supabase-cli) to your Supabase account using the CLI.

### Configure a CNAME

Set up a CNAME record for `api.example.com`, resolving to `foobarbaz.supabase.co.`, with as low a TTL as possible.

### Configure TXT Verification

Use the `create` subcommand of the CLI to notify Supabase of your domain and retrieve TXT verification records:

```bash
supabase domains create --project-ref foobarbaz --custom-hostname api.example.com --experimental
```

The output of the `create` command includes two TXT records[^1] you will need to set up, in order to verify your control over the domain in question,
and for us to issue SSL certificates for it. For example:

```bash
[...]
Required outstanding validation records:
        _cf-custom-hostname.api.example.com TXT -> 46BBC14D-D50A-409C-8DB5-F862CF5BA660
        api.example.com TXT -> ca3-F1HvR9i938OgVwpCFwi1jTsbhe1hvT0Ic3efPY3Q
```

[^1] One of the records requires you to _replace_ the CNAME record set up in [the first step](#configure-a-cname) with a TXT record. You'll be able to restore it back to the CNAME after the verification process has been completed.

### Verify your domain

Set up both records as instructed, and then use the `reverify` command for the Supabase Platform to verify the records:

```bash
supabase domains reverify --project-ref foobarbaz --experimental
```

You might need to wait a few minutes before your updated DNS records are propagated, especially if the older records were using a high TTL.

### Activate your domain

The final activation step reconfigures your project to start serving traffic on your custom domain (`api.example.com`).
The auth service, in particular, will no longer work with the original URL (`foobarbaz.supabase.co`).
As such, it is recommended that you schedule a downtime window of 20-30 minutes, depending on the complexity of your project, to update all the services that need to know about your custom domain:

- Any client code (e.g., frontends, mobile apps). You can initialize a new Supabase client with your custom domain, `api.example.com`. For example:

  ```js
  import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

  // Use a custom domain as the supabase URL
  const supabase = createClient('https://api.example.com', 'public-anon-key')
  ```

- Any OAuth providers (e.g., google, github)

Additionally, update the DNS configuration for `api.example.com` to once more use a CNAME record that resolves to `foobarbaz.supabase.co`.
Finally, you can use the `activate` subcommand to reconfigure your project:

```bash
supabase domains activate --project-ref foobarbaz --experimental
```

## Remove a Custom Domain

If you have a custom domain (`api.example.com`) set up for your Supabase project (ref `foobarbaz`, with assigned endpoints at `foobarbaz.supabase.co`), and would like to go back to using the Supabase-provisioned endpoints (`foobarbaz.supabase.co`), you can use the `delete` subcommand:

```bash
supabase domains delete --project-ref foobarbaz --experimental
```

As with the final activation stage of the process for setting up a custom domain, you'll need to update any references in your client code and OAuth providers from the custom domain to the Supabase-provisioned endpoints.

## Vanity Subdomains

Vanity Subdomains allow you to present a basic branded experience, compared to custom domains. They allow you to host your services at a custom subdomain on Supabase (e.g., `my-example-brand.supabase.co`) instead of the default, randomly-assigned `foobarbaz.supabase.co`.

To get started:

1. [Install](/docs/guides/resources/supabase-cli) the Supabase CLI 1.22.0+.
1. [Log in](/docs/guides/resources/supabase-getting-started/local-development#log-in-to-the-supabase-cli) to your Supabase account using the CLI.
1. Ensure that you have [Owner or Admin permissions](/docs/guides/platform/access-control#manage-team-members) for the project you'd like to set up a vanity subdomain for.
1. Ensure that your organization is on a paid plan (Pro/Team/Enterprise plan) in the [Billing page of the Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/org/_/billing).

## Configure a Vanity Subdomain

This example assumes your Supabase project is `foobarbaz` with a corresponding API URL `foobarbaz.supabase.co` and configures a vanity subdomain at `my-example-brand.supabase.co`.

### Check subdomain availability

Use the `check-availability` subcommand of the CLI to check if your desired subdomain is available for use:

```bash
supabase vanity-subdomains --project-ref foobarbaz check-availability --desired-subdomain my-example-brand --experimental
```

### Activate a subdomain

Once you've chosen an available subdomain, you can reconfigure your Supabase project to start serving traffic on the vanity subdomain (`my-example-brand.supabase.co`).
The auth service, in particular, will no longer work with the original URL (`foobarbaz.supabase.co`).
As such, it is recommended that you schedule a downtime window of 20-30 minutes, depending on the complexity of your project, to update all the services that need to know about your vanity subdomain:

- any client code (e.g., frontends, mobile apps)
- any OAuth providers (e.g., Google, GitHub)

The `activate` subcommand can be used to initiate the activation:

```bash
supabase vanity-subdomains --project-ref fwmssjhjgszhnavvqxnt activate --desired-subdomain my-example-subdomain --experimental
```

## Remove a Vanity Subdomain

If you have a vanity subdomain (`my-example-brand.supabase.co`) set up for your Supabase project (ref `foobarbaz`, with assigned endpoints at `foobarbaz.supabase.co`), and would like to go back to using the Supabase-provisioned endpoints (`foobarbaz.supabase.co`), you can use the `delete` subcommand:

```bash
supabase vanity-subdomains delete --project-ref foobarbaz --experimental
```

As with the final activation stage of the process for setting up a vanity subdomain, you'll need to update any references in your client code and OAuth providers from the vanity subdomain to the Supabase-provisioned endpoints.

## Limitations

- A Supabase project can—at this time—use either a Custom Domain or a Vanity Subdomain, but not both.
- Some authentication flows like Sign-in with Twitter set cookies to track the progress of the flow. Make sure you use only one domain in your frontend application for this reason. Mixing calls to the Supabase domain `foobarbaz.supabase.co` and your custom domain could cause those flows to stop working due to the [Same Origin Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy) enforced on cookies by the browser.
