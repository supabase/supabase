Database size refers to the _monthly average storage usage_, as reported by Postgres. This metric is reported in your project's [billing usage](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/settings/billing/usage) and is updated daily. As you read this document we will refer to "database size" and "disk size":

- "Database size" is the total size of used storage from your database.
- "Disk size" describes the size of the underlying available storage.

## Database space management

### Database size

This SQL query will show the current size of your Postgres database:

```sql
select
  sum(pg_database_size(pg_database.datname)) / (1024 * 1024) as db_size_mb
from pg_database;
```

This value is reported in the [database settings page](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/settings/database).

Database Space is consumed primarily by your data, indexes, and materialized views. You can reduce your disk size by removing any of these and running a Vacuum operation.

<Admonition type="note">

Depending on your billing tier, your database can go into read-only mode which can prevent you inserting and deleting data. There are instructions for managing read-only mode in the [Disk Management](#disk-management) section.

### Vacuum operations

Postgres does not immediately reclaim the physical space used by dead tuples (i.e., deleted rows) in the DB. They are marked as "removed" until a [vacuum operation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/routine-vacuuming.html) is executed. As a result, deleting data from your database may not immediately reduce the reported disk usage.

<Admonition type="note">

Vacuum operations can temporarily increase resource utilization, which may adversely impact the observed performance of your project until the maintenance is completed.

</Admonition>

Supabase projects have automatic vacuuming enabled, which ensures that these operations are performed regularly to keep the database healthy and performant.
It is possible to [fine-tune](https://www.percona.com/blog/2018/08/10/tuning-autovacuum-in-postgresql-and-autovacuum-internals/)
the [autovacuum parameters](https://www.enterprisedb.com/blog/postgresql-vacuum-and-analyze-best-practice-tips),
or [manually initiate](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-vacuum.html) vacuum operations.
Running a manual vacuum after deleting large amounts of data from your DB could help reduce the database size reported by Postgres.

### Preoccupied Space

New Supabase projects have a database size of ~40-60mb. This space includes pre-installed extensions, schemas, and default Postgres data. Additional database size is used when installing extensions, even if those extensions are inactive.

## Disk management

Supabase uses network-attached storage to balance performance with scalability. The behavior of your disk depends on your billing tier.

### Paid Tier Behavior

Pro and Enterprise projects have auto-scaling Disk Storage.

Disk storage expands automatically when the database reaches 90% of the disk size. The disk is expanded to be 50% larger (e.g., 8GB -> 12GB). Auto-scaling can only take place once every 6 hours. If within those 6 hours you reach 95% of the disk space, your project will enter read-only mode.

<Admonition type="caution">

If you intend to import a lot of data into your database which requires multiple disk expansions then [reach out to our team](https://app.supabase.com/support/new). For example, uploading more than 1.5x the current size of your database storage will put your database into [read-only mode](#read-only-mode).

</Admonition>

The maximum Disk Size for Pro Tier is 1024TB. If you need more than this, [contact us](https://app.supabase.com/support/new) to learn more about the Enterprise plan.

### Free Tier Behavior

Free Tier projects enter [read-only](#read-only-mode) mode when you exceed the 500mb limit. Once in read-only mode, you have several options:

- [Upgrade to the Pro or Enterprise tier](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/settings/billing/subscription) to enable auto-scaling and expand beyond the 500mb database size limit.
- [Disable read-only mode](#disabling-read-only-mode) and reduce your database size.

### Read-only mode

In some cases Supabase may put your database into read-only mode to prevent your database from exceeding the billing or disk limitations.

In read-only mode, clients will encounter errors such as `cannot execute INSERT in a read-only transaction`. Regular operation (read-write mode) is automatically re-enabled once usage is below 95% of the disk size,

### Disabling read-only mode

You can manually override read-only mode to reduce disk size. To do this, run the following in the [SQL Editor](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/sql):

```sql
SET
  default_transaction_read_only = 'off';
```

This allows you to delete data from within the session. After deleting data, you should run a vacuum to reclaim as much space as possible.
