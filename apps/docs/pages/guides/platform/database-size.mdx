Database size refers to the _monthly average storage usage_, as reported by Postgres. This metric is reported in your project's [billing usage](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/settings/billing/usage) and is updated daily.
Database size is the total size of used storage from your database, whereas disk size describes the size of the underlying available storage.

For an instantaneous live view of the DB size, you can execute in Postgres:

```sql
select
  sum(pg_database_size (pg_database.datname)) / (1024 * 1024) as db_size_mb
from
  pg_database;
```

This value is also reported in the [database settings page](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/settings/database).

## Database storage management

Supabase uses network-attached storage to balance performance with scalability.

### Free tier project

For [**Free tier projects**](#free-tier-project), the database can enter ['read only' mode when you exceed the 500mb limit](#free-tier-project-read-only-mode).

#### Free tier project 'read-only' mode

Free tier projects can enter read-only mode when exceeding the 500mb database size limit.

In read-only mode, clients will encounter errors such as `cannot execute INSERT in a read-only transaction`.
Regular operation (read-write mode) is automatically re-enabled once database storage is below the 500mb database size limit.

#### Increasing available database space

If your project is on the free tier, there is a 500mb Database size limit.

- If you are in [read-only](#free-tier-project-read-only-mode) mode:

  - Then you can [upgrade to the Pro or Enterprise tier](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/settings/billing/subscription) to go beyond the 500mb database size limit.
  - However; If your project database is already in [read-only](#free-tier-project-read-only-mode) mode, run the following command to change the transaction mode to read-write for your session
    (This allows you to delete data from within the session).

    ```sql
    SET
      default_transaction_read_only = 'off';
    ```

- If you are over your limit, but not in [read-only](#free-tier-project-read-only-mode) mode yet, it's important to reduce your Database size as your database might go into [read-only](#free-tier-project-read-only-mode) mode.

### Paid tier project

For **Pro and Enterprise tier projects**, your [disk size expands automatically](#paid-tier-disk-auto-scaling).

#### Paid tier disk auto-scaling

Pro and Enterprise have Disk size auto-scaling. Database storage expands automatically when the database reaches 90% of the disk size. The disk is expanded to be 50% larger (e.g., 8GB -> 12GB).
Auto-scaling can only take place once every 6 hours.

<Admonition type="caution">

If you intend to import a lot of data into your database that would require multiple storage expansions then [reach out to our team](https://app.supabase.com/support/new), otherwise your project might enter a ['read-only' mode](#paid-tier-project-read-only-mode).

</Admonition>

You may require multiple storage expansions in a short period of time. For example, you need to upload more than 1.5x the current size of your database storage. This will lead to your database entering a [read-only mode](#paid-tier-project-read-only-mode). You can avoid this by [contacting the support team](https://app.supabase.com/support/new) so that your database can be resized to a sufficient amount before you start uploading to it.

If you need more than 1024TB of disk size, you can [contact us](https://app.supabase.com/support/new) to learn more about the Enterprise plan.

#### Paid tier project 'read-only' mode

Database storage expands, at most, once every 6 hours.
If within those 6 hours you reach 95% of the disk space, your project will enter read-only mode.

In read-only mode, clients will encounter errors such as `cannot execute INSERT in a read-only transaction`.
Regular operation (read-write mode) is automatically re-enabled once usage is below 95% of the disk size, or when the database automatically resizes after the 6 hour period.

#### Increasing available database space

For Pro and Enterprise tier projects that are [nearing their disk size limit](#paid-tier-project-read-only-mode), you can increase available disk size by deleting data from your project's database to lower its disk usage.

If your project database is already in [read-only](#paid-tier-project-read-only-mode) mode, run the following command to change the transaction mode to read-write for your session:

```sql
SET
  default_transaction_read_only = 'off';
```

This allows you to delete data from within the session.

### Preoccupied Space

When launching a new project, your database size will be roughly ~40-60mb.
The space is used up by preinstalled extensions, schema/data used by our services that are offered with each project and default Postgres data.

When installing additional extensions, even if you don't actively use them, additional database size is used.

## Vacuum operations

Postgres does not immediately reclaim the physical space used by dead tuples (i.e., deleted rows) in the DB. Instead, they are internally marked as removed until a [vacuum operation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/routine-vacuuming.html) is executed.
As a result, deleting data from your database may not immediately reduce the reported disk usage.

<Admonition type="note">

Vacuum operations can temporarily increase resource utilization, which may adversely impact the observed performance of your project until the maintenance is completed.

</Admonition>

Supabase projects have automatic vacuuming enabled, which ensures that these operations are performed regularly to keep the database healthy and performant.
However, it can be necessary to either [fine-tune](https://www.percona.com/blog/2018/08/10/tuning-autovacuum-in-postgresql-and-autovacuum-internals/)
the [autovacuum parameters](https://www.enterprisedb.com/blog/postgresql-vacuum-and-analyze-best-practice-tips),
or [manually initiate](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-vacuum.html) vacuum operations.
For example, running a manual vacuum after deleting large amounts of data from your DB could help reduce the reported disk usage by Postgres.
