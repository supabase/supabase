Supabase is great for building something very fast _and_ for scaling up. However, it's important to note that as your application matures and your team expands, the practices you use for managing an application in production should not be the same as the practices you used for prototyping.

## Prototyping

The Dashboard is a quick and easy tool for building applications while you are prototyping. That said, we strongly recommend using [Migrations](/docs/guides/getting-started/local-development#database-migrations) to manage your database changes. You can use our CLI to [capture any changes](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-db-diff) you have made on the Dashboard so that you can commit them a version control system, like git.

## Collaborating

As soon as you start collaborating with team members, all project changes should be in version control. At this point we strongly recommend moving away from using the Dashboard for schema changes. Use migrations to manage your database, and check them into your version control system to track every change.

- [Database migrations](/docs/guides/getting-started/local-development#database-migrations)
- [Managing access on the Dashboard](/docs/guides/platform/access-control)
- [PGAudit for Postgres](/docs/guides/database/extensions/pgaudit)

## In Production

Once your application is live, you should never change your database using the Dashboard. Supabase provides various [access levels](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/access-control) for the Dashboard that can help enforce this. Some other important things to consider at this point include:

- Read the [Production Checklist](/docs/guides/platform/going-into-prod).
- Make your team aware of the [Shared Responsibilities](/docs/guides/platform/shared-responsibility-model) between your organization and Supabase.
- Design a [safe workflow](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/shared-responsibility-model#you-decide-your-own-workflow) for managing your database. We strongly recommend running [multiple environments](/docs/guides/cli/managing-environments) as part of your development workflow (`local` -> `staging` -> `prod`).
- As your database to grows, we strongly recommend moving to [Point-in-Time Recovery](/docs/guides/platform/backups#point-in-time-recovery). This is safer and has less impact on your database performance during maintenance windows.

- [Managing environments](/docs/guides/cli/managing-environments)

## Enterprise

For a more secure setup, consider running your workload across several organizations. It's a common pattern to have a Production organization which is restricted to only those team members who are qualified to have direct access to production databases.
