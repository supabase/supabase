Docker is the easiest way to get started with self-hosted Supabase. This guide assumes you are running the command from the machine you intend to host from.

## Before you begin

You need the following installed in your system: [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and Docker ([Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/), [MacOS](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/), or [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/)).

## Running Supabase

Running a self-hosted Supabase project is simple. Follow the steps below:

```sh
# Get the code
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/supabase/supabase

# Go to the docker folder
cd supabase/docker

# Copy the fake env vars
cp .env.example .env

# Start
docker compose up
```

Now visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to start using Supabase Studio.

That's everything you need to get started. The rest of this guide will help you to customize your setup.

## Securing your setup

While we provided you with some example secrets for getting started, you should NEVER deploy your Supabase setup using the defaults we have provided.

### Generate API Keys

Create a new `JWT_SECRET` and store it securely. 

We can use your JWT Secret to generate new `anon` and `service` API keys using the form below. Update the "JWT Secret" and then run "Generate JWT" once for the `SERVICE_KEY` and once for the `ANON_KEY`:

<JwtGenerator />

### Update API Keys

Replace the values in these files:

- `.env`:
  - `ANON_KEY` - replace with an `anon` key
  - `SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - replace with a `service` key
- `volumes/api/kong.yml`
  - `anon` - replace with an `anon` key
  - `service_role` - replace with a `service` key

### Update Secrets

Update the `.env` file with your own secrets. In particular, these are required:

- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: the password for the `postgres` role.
- `JWT_SECRET`: used by PostgREST and GoTrue, among others.
- `SITE_URL`: the base URL of your site.
- `SMTP_*`: mail server credentials. You can use any SMTP server.

## Exposing services

The services running on the machine are not exposed to the internet by default. We recommend using a reverse proxy such as [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/) or [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) if you want to expose the services publicly:

1. Install Caddy using the official [instructions](https://caddyserver.com/docs/install).
2. Modify the `Caddyfile` at `./docker/deploy/caddy/Caddyfile`.
    1. Replace `localhost` with your domain.
    2. Uncomment the "Dashboard" section if you want to expose the Supabase Dashboard. You **MUST** set a password for this to be secure.
3. Run `caddy run --config ./docker/deploy/caddy/Caddyfile` to start Caddy.

You can now access your services at the following URLs:

- REST: `https://<your-domain>/proxy/rest/v1/`
- Auth: `https://<your-domain>/proxy/auth/v1/`
- Storage: `https://<your-domain>/proxy/storage/v1/`
- Functions: `https://<your-domain>/proxy/functions/v1/`
- Realtime: `https://<your-domain>/proxy/realtime/v1/`
- Dashboard: `https://<your-domain>/` (if you uncommented the Dashboard section in the Caddyfile)

## Stop 

You can stop Supabase by running `docker compose stop` in same directory as your `docker-compose.yml` file.

## Uninstall

You can stop Supabase by running `docker compose down -v` in same directory as your `docker-compose.yml` file.

## Advanced configuration

Each system can be [configured](../self-hosting#configuration) independently. Some of the most important configuration options are:

- Consider deploying the database to a different server than the rest of the services
- Update Storage to use S3 instead of the filesystem backend
- Configure Auth with a production-ready SMTP server

### Setting up Edge Functions

Your Functions are stored in `volumes/functions`. The default setup has a `hello` Function that you can invoke on `http://localhost:8000/functions/v1/hello`. You can add new Functions as `volumes/functions/<Function name>/index.ts`.


### Using an external database

We strongly recommend [decoupling your database](../self-hosting#managing-your-database) from `docker-compose` before deploying.
The middleware will run with any PostgreSQL database that has logical replication enabled. The following environment variables should be updated
in the `.env` file to point to your external database:

```bash .env
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your-super-secret-and-long-postgres-password

POSTGRES_HOST=db
POSTGRES_DB=postgres
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
```

Once you have done this, you can safely comment out the `db` section of the `docker-compose` file, and remove any instances where the services `depends_on` the `db` image.

Supabase services require your external database to be initialized with a specific schema. Refer to our [postgres/migrations](https://github.com/supabase/postgres/tree/develop/migrations) repository for instructions on running these migrations.

Note that you need superuser permission on the postgres role to perform the initial schema migration. Once completed, the postgres role will be demoted to non-superuser to prevent abuse.

### Setting database's `log_min_messages`

By default, `docker compose` sets the database's `log_min_messages` configuration to `fatal` to prevent redundant logs generated by Realtime.
However, you might miss important log messages such as database errors. Configure `log_min_messages` based on your needs.

### File storage backend on macOS

By default, Storage backend is set to `file`, which is to use local files as the storage backend. To make it work on macOS, you need to choose `VirtioFS` as the Docker container file sharing implementation (in Docker Desktop -> Preferences -> General).

### Setting up logging with the Analytics server

Additional configuration is required for self-hosting the Analytics server. For the full setup instructions, see [Self Hosting Analytics](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/self-hosting-analytics/introduction#getting-started).
