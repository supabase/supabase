Docker is the easiest way to get started with self-hosted Supabase. This guide assumes you are running the command from the machine you intend to host from.

## Before you begin

You need the following installed in your system: [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and Docker ([Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/), [MacOS](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/), or [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/)).

## Running Supabase

Follow these steps to start Supabase locally:

```sh
# Get the code
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/supabase/supabase

# Go to the docker folder
cd supabase/docker

# Copy the fake env vars
cp .env.example .env

# Pull the latest images
docker compose pull

# Start the services (in detached mode)
docker compose up -d
```

After all the services have started you can see them running in the background:

```sh
docker compose ps
```
Please [secure your services](#securing-your-services) as soon as possible using the instructions below.

### Accessing Supabase Studio

You can access the Supabase Dashboard through the API gateway on port `8000`. For example: `http://<your-ip>:8000`, or [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) if you are running Docker locally.

You will be prompted for a username and password. By default, the credentials are:

- Username: `supabase`
- Password: `this_password_is_insecure_and_should_be_updated`

You should change these credentials as soon as possible using the [instructions](#dashboard-authentication) below.

### Accessing the APIs

Each of the APIs are available through the the same API gateway:

- REST: `http://<your-ip>:8000/rest/v1/`
- Auth: `http://<your-domain>:8000/auth/v1/`
- Storage: `http://<your-domain>:8000/storage/v1/`
- Realtime: `http://<your-domain>:8000/realtime/v1/`

### Accessing your Edge Functions

Edge Functions are stored in `volumes/functions`. The default setup has a `hello` Function that you can invoke on `http://<your-domain>:8000/functions/v1/hello`.

You can add new Functions as `volumes/functions/<FUNCTION_NAME>/index.ts`. Restart the `functions` service to pick up the changes: `docker compose restart functions --no-deps`

### Accessing Postgres

You can connect to the Postgres database locally on port `5432`. For example, if you have `psql` on your local machine you can run:

```bash
psql -h localhost -p 5432 -d postgres -U postgres
```

The default password is `your-super-secret-and-long-postgres-password`. You should change this as soon as possible using the [instructions below](#update-secrets). By default the database is not accessible from outside the local machine. You can [change this](#exposing-your-postgres-database) by updating the `docker-compose.yml` file.


## Securing your services

While we provided you with some example secrets for getting started, you should NEVER deploy your Supabase setup using the defaults we have provided. Please follow all of the steps in this section to ensure you have a secure setup, and then [restart all services](#restarting-all-services) to pick up the changes.

### Generate API Keys

Create a new `JWT_SECRET` and store it securely.

We can use your JWT Secret to generate new `anon` and `service` API keys using the form below. Update the "JWT Secret" and then run "Generate JWT" once for the `SERVICE_KEY` and once for the `ANON_KEY`:

<JwtGenerator />

### Update API Keys

Replace the values in the `.env` file:

  - `ANON_KEY` - replace with an `anon` key
  - `SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - replace with a `service` key

You will need to [restart](#restarting-all-services) the services for the changes to take effect.

### Update Secrets

Update the `.env` file with your own secrets. In particular, these are required:

- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: the password for the `postgres` role.
- `JWT_SECRET`: used by PostgREST and GoTrue, among others.
- `SITE_URL`: the base URL of your site.
- `SMTP_*`: mail server credentials. You can use any SMTP server.

You will need to [restart](#restarting-all-services) the services for the changes to take effect.

### Dashboard Authentication

The dashboard is protected with Basic Authentication. The default user and password MUST be updated before using Supabase in production.
Update the following values in the `.env` file:
 - `DASHBOARD_USERNAME`: The default username for the Dashboard
 - `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD`: The default password for the Dashboard

You can also add more credentials in `./docker/volumes/api/kong.yml`. For example:

```yaml docker/volumes/api/kong.yml
basicauth_credentials:
- consumer: DASHBOARD
  username: user_one
  password: password_one
- consumer: DASHBOARD
  username: user_two
  password: password_two
```

You will need to [restart](#restarting-all-services) the services for the changes to take effect.

## Restarting all services

You can restart services to pick up any configuration changes by running:

```sh
docker compose restart
```

Be aware that this will result in downtime while the services are restarting.

## Stopping all services

You can stop Supabase by running `docker compose stop` in same directory as your `docker-compose.yml` file.

## Uninstalling

You can stop Supabase by running the following in same directory as your `docker-compose.yml` file:

```sh
# Stop docker and remove volumes:
docker compose down -v

# Remove Postgres data:
rm -rf volumes/db/data/
```

This will destroy all data in the database and storage volumes, so be careful!

## Common configuration

Each system can be [configured](../self-hosting#configuration) independently. Some of the most common configuration options are listed below.

### Configuring an email server

You will need to use a production-ready SMTP server for sending emails. You can configure the SMTP server by updating the the following environment variables:

```sh .env
SMTP_ADMIN_EMAIL=
SMTP_HOST=
SMTP_PORT=
SMTP_USER=
SMTP_PASS=
SMTP_SENDER_NAME=
```

We recommend using [AWS SES](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/). It's extremely cheap and reliable. Restart all services to pick up the new configuration.

### Configuring S3 Storage

By default all files are stored locally on the server. You can connfigure the Storage service to use S3 by updating the following environment variables:

```yaml docker-compose.yml
  storage:
    environment:
      STORAGE_BACKEND=s3
      GLOBAL_S3_BUCKET=name-of-your-s3-bucket
      REGION=region-of-your-s3-bucket
```

You can find all the available options in the [storage repository](https://github.com/supabase/storage-api/blob/master/.env.sample). Restart the `storage` service to pick up the changes: `docker compose restart storage --no-deps`

### Setting database's `log_min_messages`

By default, `docker compose` sets the database's `log_min_messages` configuration to `fatal` to prevent redundant logs generated by Realtime. You can configure `log_min_messages` using any of the Postgres [Severity Levels](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-logging.html#RUNTIME-CONFIG-SEVERITY-LEVELS).

### Exposing your Postgres database

By default, the Postgres database is only accessible locally. If you want to expose it to the outside world, you can update the `docker-compose.yml` file and remove the `127.0.0.1:` prefix from the `ports` section:

```yaml docker-compose.yml
  db:
    ports:
      - ${POSTGRES_PORT}:${POSTGRES_PORT}
```

This is less-secure, so please make sure you are running a firewall in front of your server.

### File storage backend on macOS

By default, Storage backend is set to `file`, which is to use local files as the storage backend. For macOS compatibility, you need to choose `VirtioFS` as the Docker container file sharing implementation (in Docker Desktop -> Preferences -> General).

### Setting up logging with the Analytics server

Additional configuration is required for self-hosting the Analytics server. For the full setup instructions, see [Self Hosting Analytics](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/self-hosting-analytics/introduction#getting-started).

### Upgrading Analytics

Due to the changes in the Analytics server, you will need to run the following commands to upgrade your Analytics server:

<Admonition type="warning">

- All data in analytics will be deleted when you run the commands below.

</Admonition>


```sh
### Destroy analytics to transition to postgres self hosted solution without other data loss

# Enter the container and use your .env POSTGRES_PASSWORD value to login
docker exec -it $(docker ps | grep supabase-db | awk '{print $1}') psql -U supabase_admin --password
# Drop all the data in the _analytics schema
DROP PUBLICATION logflare_pub; DROP SCHEMA _analytics CASCADE; CREATE SCHEMA _analytics;\q
# Drop the analytics container
docker rm supabase-db
```
