Docker is the easiest way to get started with self-hosted Supabase.

## Before you begin

You need the following installed in your system:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Quick Start

### Get the code

Checkout the docker directory in the Supabase repo:

```sh
# Get the code
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/supabase/supabase

# Go to the docker folder
cd supabase/docker

# Copy the fake env vars
cp .env.example .env

# Start
docker compose up
```

Now visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to start using Supabase Studio.

## Securing your setup

While we provided you with some example secrets for getting started, you should NEVER deploy your Supabase setup using the defaults we have provided.

Follow these steps to secure your Docker setup. We strongly recommend using a [secrets manager](../self-hosting#managing-your-secrets) when deploying to production.

### Generate API Keys

Use your `JWT_SECRET` to generate a `anon` and `service` API keys using the [JWT generator](../self-hosting#api-keys).

Replace the values in these files:

- `.env`:
  - `ANON_KEY` - replace with an `anon` key
  - `SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - replace with a `service` key
- `volumes/api/kong.yml`
  - `anon` - replace with an `anon` key
  - `service_role` - replace with a `service` key

### Update Secrets

Update the `.env` file with your own secrets. In particular, these are required:

- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: the password for the `postgres` role.
- `JWT_SECRET`: used by PostgREST and GoTrue, among others.
- `SITE_URL`: the base URL of your site.
- `SMTP_*`: mail server credentials. You can use any SMTP server.

### Securing the Dashboard

The Docker setup doesn't include a management database for managing users and logins. If you plan to deploy the Studio to the web we suggest you put it behind a web proxy with Basic Auth or hide it behind a VPN.

## Configuration

Each system can be [configured](../self-hosting#configuration) to suit your particular use-case.

To keep the setup simple, we made some choices that may not be optimal for production:

- the database is in the same machine as the servers
- Storage uses the filesystem backend instead of S3
- Auth should be configured with a production-ready SMTP server

### Using an external database

We strongly recommend [decoupling your database](../self-hosting#managing-your-database) from `docker-compose` before deploying.
The middleware will run with any PostgreSQL database that has logical replication enabled. The following environment variables should be updated
in the `.env` file to point to your external database:

```env title=.env
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your-super-secret-and-long-postgres-password

POSTGRES_HOST=db
POSTGRES_DB=postgres
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
```

Once you have done this, you can safely comment out the `db` section of the `docker-compose` file, and remove any instances where the services `depends_on` the `db` image.

Supabase services require your external database to be initialized with a specific schema. Refer to our [postgres/migrations](https://github.com/supabase/postgres/tree/develop/migrations) repository for instructions on running these migrations.

Note that you need superuser permission on the postgres role to perform the initial schema migration. Once completed, the postgres role will be demoted to non-superuser to prevent abuse.

### Setting database's `log_min_messages`

By default, `docker compose` sets the database's `log_min_messages` configuration to `fatal` to prevent redundant logs generated by Realtime.
However, you might miss important log messages such as database errors. Configure `log_min_messages` based on your needs.

### File storage backend on macOS

By default, Storage backend is set to `file`, which is to use local files as the storage backend. To make it work on macOS, you need to choose `VirtioFS` as the Docker container file sharing implementation (in Docker Desktop -> Preferences -> General).

## Deploying

See the following guides to deploy Docker Compose setup using your preferred tool and platform:

- [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/stack-deploy/)
- [AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/deploy-applications-on-amazon-ecs-using-docker-compose/)
- [Using Kompose for Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/translate-compose-kubernetes/)
