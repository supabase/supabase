## About RedwoodJS

A Redwood application is split into two parts: a frontend and a backend. This is represented as two node projects within a single monorepo.

The frontend project is called **`web`** and the backend project is called **`api`**. For clarity, we will refer to these in prose as **"sides"**, i.e. the "web side" and the "api side".
They are separate projects because code on the `web side` will end up running in the user's browser while code on the `api side` will run on a server somewhere.

<Admonition type="note">

Important: When this guide refers to "API", that means the Supabase API and when it refers to "api side", that means the RedwoodJS `api side`.

</Admonition>

The **`api side`** is an implementation of a GraphQL API. The business logic is organized into "services" that represent their own internal API and can be called both from external GraphQL requests and other internal services.

The **`web side`** is built with React. Redwood's router makes it simple to map URL paths to React "Page" components (and automatically code-split your app on each route).
Pages may contain a "Layout" component to wrap content. They also contain "Cells" and regular React components.
Cells allow you to declaratively manage the lifecycle of a component that fetches and displays data.

For the sake of consistency with the other framework tutorials, we'll build this app a little differently than normal.
We **_won't use_** Prisma to connect to the Supabase Postgres database or [Prisma migrations](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/cli-commands#prisma-migrate) as one typically might in a Redwood app.
Instead, we'll rely on the Supabase client to do some of the work on the **`web`** side and use the client again on the **`api`** side to do data fetching as well.

That means you will want to refrain from running any `yarn rw prisma migrate` commands and also double check your build commands on deployment to ensure Prisma won't reset your database. Prisma currently doesn't support cross-schema foreign keys, so introspecting the schema fails due
to how your Supabase `public` schema references the `auth.users`.

<ProjectSetup />

## Building the App

Let's start building the RedwoodJS app from scratch.

<Admonition type="note">

RedwoodJS requires Node.js `>= 14.x <= 16.x` and Yarn `>= 1.15`.

</Admonition>

Make sure you have installed yarn since RedwoodJS relies on it to [manage its packages in workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/) for its `web` and `api` "sides".

### Initialize a RedwoodJS app

We can use [Create Redwood App](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/quick-start) command to initialize
an app called `supabase-redwoodjs`:

```bash
yarn create redwood-app supabase-redwoodjs
cd supabase-redwoodjs
```

While the app is installing, you should see:

```bash
✔ Creating Redwood app
  ✔ Checking node and yarn compatibility
  ✔ Creating directory 'supabase-redwoodjs'
✔ Installing packages
  ✔ Running 'yarn install'... (This could take a while)
✔ Convert TypeScript files to JavaScript
✔ Generating types

Thanks for trying out Redwood!
```

Then let's install the only additional dependency [supabase-js](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js) by running the `setup auth` command:

```bash
yarn redwood setup auth supabase
```

When prompted:

> Overwrite existing /api/src/lib/auth.[jt]s?

Say, **yes** and it will setup the Supabase client in your app and also provide hooks used with Supabase authentication.

```bash
✔ Generating auth lib...
  ✔ Successfully wrote file `./api/src/lib/auth.js`
  ✔ Adding auth config to web...
  ✔ Adding auth config to GraphQL API...
  ✔ Adding required web packages...
  ✔ Installing packages...
  ✔ One more thing...

  You will need to add your Supabase URL (SUPABASE_URL), public API KEY,
  and JWT SECRET (SUPABASE_KEY, and SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET) to your .env file.
```

Next, we want to save the environment variables in a `.env`.
We need the `API URL` as well as the `anon` and `jwt_secret` keys that you copied [earlier](#get-the-api-keys).

```bash .env
SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_URL
SUPABASE_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET=YOUR_SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET
```

And finally, you will also need to save **just** the `web side` environment variables to the `redwood.toml`.

```bash redwood.toml
[web]
  title = "Supabase Redwood Tutorial"
  port = 8910
  apiProxyPath = "/.redwood/functions"
  includeEnvironmentVariables = ["SUPABASE_URL", "SUPABASE_KEY"]
[api]
  port = 8911
[browser]
  open = true
```

These variables will be exposed on the browser, and that's completely fine.
They allow your web app to initialize the Supabase client with your public anon key
since we have [Row Level Security](/docs/guides/auth#row-level-security) enabled on our Database.

You'll see these being used to configure your Supabase client in `web/src/App.js`:

```js web/src/App.js
// ... Redwood imports
import { AuthProvider } from '@redwoodjs/auth'
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

// ...

const supabase = createClient(process.env.SUPABASE_URL, process.env.SUPABASE_KEY)

const App = () => (
  <FatalErrorBoundary page={FatalErrorPage}>
    <RedwoodProvider titleTemplate="%PageTitle | %AppTitle">
      <AuthProvider client={supabase} type="supabase">
        <RedwoodApolloProvider>
          <Routes />
        </RedwoodApolloProvider>
      </AuthProvider>
    </RedwoodProvider>
  </FatalErrorBoundary>
)

export default App
```

And one optional step is to update the CSS file `web/src/index.css` to make the app look nice.
You can find the full contents of this file [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/supabase/supabase/master/examples/user-management/react-user-management/src/index.css).

### Start RedwoodJS and your first Page

Let's test our setup at the moment by starting up the app:

```bash
yarn rw dev
```

<Admonition type="note">
  `rw` is an alias for `redwood`, as in `yarn rw` to run Redwood CLI commands.
</Admonition>

You should see a "Welcome to RedwoodJS" page and a message about not having any pages yet.

So, let's create a "home" page:

```bash
yarn rw generate page home /

✔ Generating page files...
  ✔ Successfully wrote file `./web/src/pages/HomePage/HomePage.stories.js`
  ✔ Successfully wrote file `./web/src/pages/HomePage/HomePage.test.js`
  ✔ Successfully wrote file `./web/src/pages/HomePage/HomePage.js`
✔ Updating routes file...
✔ Generating types ...
```

<Admonition type="note">

The `/` is important here as it creates a root level route.

</Admonition>

You can stop the `dev` server if you want; to see your changes, just be sure to run `yarn rw dev` again.

You should see the `Home` page route in `web/src/Routes.js`:

```bash web/src/Routes.js
import { Router, Route } from '@redwoodjs/router'

const Routes = () => {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Route path="/" page={HomePage} name="home" />
      <Route notfound page={NotFoundPage} />
    </Router>
  )
}

export default Routes
```

### Set up a Login component

Let's set up a Redwood component to manage logins and sign ups. We'll use Magic Links, so users can sign in with their email without using passwords.

```bash
yarn rw g component auth

  ✔ Generating component files...
    ✔ Successfully wrote file `./web/src/components/Auth/Auth.test.js`
    ✔ Successfully wrote file `./web/src/components/Auth/Auth.stories.js`
    ✔ Successfully wrote file `./web/src/components/Auth/Auth.js`

```

Now, update the `Auth.js` component to contain:

```jsx /web/src/components/Auth/Auth.js
import { useState } from 'react'
import { useAuth } from '@redwoodjs/auth'

const Auth = () => {
  const { logIn } = useAuth()
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false)
  const [email, setEmail] = useState('')

  const handleLogin = async (email) => {
    try {
      setLoading(true)
      const { error } = await logIn({ email })
      if (error) throw error
      alert('Check your email for the login link!')
    } catch (error) {
      alert(error.error_description || error.message)
    } finally {
      setLoading(false)
    }
  }

  return (
    <div className="row flex-center flex">
      <div className="col-6 form-widget">
        <h1 className="header">Supabase + RedwoodJS</h1>
        <p className="description">Sign in via magic link with your email below</p>
        <div>
          <input
            className="inputField"
            type="email"
            placeholder="Your email"
            value={email}
            onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}
          />
        </div>
        <div>
          <button
            onClick={(e) => {
              e.preventDefault()
              handleLogin(email)
            }}
            className={'button block'}
            disabled={loading}
          >
            {loading ? <span>Loading</span> : <span>Send magic link</span>}
          </button>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Auth
```

### Set up an Account component

After a user is signed in we can allow them to edit their profile details and manage their account.

Let's create a new component for that called `Account.js`.

```bash
yarn rw g component account

  ✔ Generating component files...
    ✔ Successfully wrote file `./web/src/components/Account/Account.test.js`
    ✔ Successfully wrote file `./web/src/components/Account/Account.stories.js`
    ✔ Successfully wrote file `./web/src/components/Account/Account.js`
```

And then update the file to contain:

```jsx web/src/components/Account/Account.js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
import { useAuth } from '@redwoodjs/auth'

const Account = () => {
  const { client: supabase, currentUser, logOut } = useAuth()
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true)
  const [username, setUsername] = useState(null)
  const [website, setWebsite] = useState(null)
  const [avatar_url, setAvatarUrl] = useState(null)

  useEffect(() => {
    getProfile()
  }, [supabase.auth.session])

  async function getProfile() {
    try {
      setLoading(true)
      const user = supabase.auth.user()

      let { data, error, status } = await supabase
        .from('profiles')
        .select(`username, website, avatar_url`)
        .eq('id', user.id)
        .single()

      if (error && status !== 406) {
        throw error
      }

      if (data) {
        setUsername(data.username)
        setWebsite(data.website)
        setAvatarUrl(data.avatar_url)
      }
    } catch (error) {
      alert(error.message)
    } finally {
      setLoading(false)
    }
  }

  async function updateProfile({ username, website, avatar_url }) {
    try {
      setLoading(true)
      const user = supabase.auth.user()

      const updates = {
        id: user.id,
        username,
        website,
        avatar_url,
        updated_at: new Date(),
      }

      let { error } = await supabase.from('profiles').upsert(updates, {
        returning: 'minimal', // Don't return the value after inserting
      })

      if (error) {
        throw error
      }

      alert('Updated profile!')
    } catch (error) {
      alert(error.message)
    } finally {
      setLoading(false)
    }
  }

  return (
    <div className="row flex-center flex">
      <div className="col-6 form-widget">
        <h1 className="header">Supabase + RedwoodJS</h1>
        <p className="description">Your profile</p>
        <div className="form-widget">
          <div>
            <label htmlFor="email">Email</label>
            <input id="email" type="text" value={currentUser.email} disabled />
          </div>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor="username">Name</label>
            <input
              id="username"
              type="text"
              value={username || ''}
              onChange={(e) => setUsername(e.target.value)}
            />
          </div>
          <div>
            <label htmlFor="website">Website</label>
            <input
              id="website"
              type="url"
              value={website || ''}
              onChange={(e) => setWebsite(e.target.value)}
            />
          </div>

          <div>
            <button
              className="button primary block"
              onClick={() => updateProfile({ username, website, avatar_url })}
              disabled={loading}
            >
              {loading ? 'Loading ...' : 'Update'}
            </button>
          </div>

          <div>
            <button className="button block" onClick={() => logOut()}>
              Sign Out
            </button>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Account
```

You'll see the use of `useAuth()` several times. Redwood's `useAuth` hook provides convenient ways to access
logIn, logOut, currentUser, and access the `supabase` authenticate client. We'll use it to get an instance
of the supabase client to interact with your API.

### Update Home Page

Now that we have all the components in place, let's update your `HomePage` page to use them:

```jsx web/src/pages/HomePage/HomePage.js
import { useAuth } from '@redwoodjs/auth'
import { MetaTags } from '@redwoodjs/web'

import Account from 'src/components/Account'
import Auth from 'src/components/Auth'

const HomePage = () => {
  const { isAuthenticated } = useAuth()

  return (
    <>
      <MetaTags title="Welcome" />
      {!isAuthenticated ? <Auth /> : <Account />}
    </>
  )
}

export default HomePage
```

> What we're doing here is showing the sign in form if you aren't logged in and your account profile if you are.

### Launch!

Once that's done, run this in a terminal window to launch the `dev` server:

```bash
yarn rw dev
```

And then open the browser to [localhost:8910](http://localhost:8910) and you should see the completed app.

![Supabase RedwoodJS](/docs/img/supabase-redwoodjs-demo.png)

## Bonus: Profile photos

Every Supabase project is configured with [Storage](/docs/guides/storage) for managing large files like photos and videos.

### Create an upload widget

Let's create an avatar for the user so that they can upload a profile photo. We can start by creating a new component:

```bash
yarn rw g component avatar
  ✔ Generating component files...
    ✔ Successfully wrote file `./web/src/components/Avatar/Avatar.test.js`
    ✔ Successfully wrote file `./web/src/components/Avatar/Avatar.stories.js`
    ✔ Successfully wrote file `./web/src/components/Avatar/Avatar.js`
```

Now, update your Avatar component to contain the following widget:

```jsx web/src/components/Avatar/Avatar.js
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'
import { useAuth } from '@redwoodjs/auth'

const Avatar = ({ url, size, onUpload }) => {
  const { client: supabase } = useAuth()

  const [avatarUrl, setAvatarUrl] = useState(null)
  const [uploading, setUploading] = useState(false)

  useEffect(() => {
    if (url) downloadImage(url)
  }, [url])

  async function downloadImage(path) {
    try {
      const { data, error } = await supabase.storage.from('avatars').download(path)
      if (error) {
        throw error
      }
      const url = URL.createObjectURL(data)
      setAvatarUrl(url)
    } catch (error) {
      console.log('Error downloading image: ', error.message)
    }
  }

  async function uploadAvatar(event) {
    try {
      setUploading(true)

      if (!event.target.files || event.target.files.length === 0) {
        throw new Error('You must select an image to upload.')
      }

      const file = event.target.files[0]
      const fileExt = file.name.split('.').pop()
      const fileName = `${Math.random()}.${fileExt}`
      const filePath = `${fileName}`

      let { error: uploadError } = await supabase.storage.from('avatars').upload(filePath, file)

      if (uploadError) {
        throw uploadError
      }

      onUpload(filePath)
    } catch (error) {
      alert(error.message)
    } finally {
      setUploading(false)
    }
  }

  return (
    <div>
      {avatarUrl ? (
        <img
          src={avatarUrl}
          alt="Avatar"
          className="avatar image"
          style={{ height: size, width: size }}
        />
      ) : (
        <div className="avatar no-image" style={{ height: size, width: size }} />
      )}
      <div style={{ width: size }}>
        <label className="button primary block" htmlFor="single">
          {uploading ? 'Uploading ...' : 'Upload'}
        </label>
        <input
          style={{
            visibility: 'hidden',
            position: 'absolute',
          }}
          type="file"
          id="single"
          accept="image/*"
          onChange={uploadAvatar}
          disabled={uploading}
        />
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Avatar
```

### Add the new widget

And then we can add the widget to the Account component:

```jsx web/src/components/Account/Account.js
// Import the new component
import Avatar from 'src/components/Avatar'

// ...

return (
  <div className="form-widget">
    {/* Add to the body */}
    <Avatar
      url={avatar_url}
      size={150}
      onUpload={(url) => {
        setAvatarUrl(url)
        updateProfile({ username, website, avatar_url: url })
      }}
    />
    {/* ... */}
  </div>
)
```

### Storage management

<StorageManagement />

At this stage you have a fully functional application!
