Supabase auto-generates three types of API directly from your database schema.

- REST - connect to your database through a restful interface, directly from the browser.
- Realtime - for listening to database changes.
- GraphQL - a fast and auto-generate GraphQL API.

All the APIs are auto-generated from your database and are designed to get you building as fast as possible, without writing a single line of code.

You can use them directly from the browser (two-tier architecture), or as a complement to your own API server (three-tier architecture).

## Features

- **Instant and auto-generated.** <br />As you update your database the changes are immediately accessible through your API.
- **Self documenting.** <br />Supabase generates documentation in the Dashboard which updates as you make database changes.
- **Secure.** <br />The API is configured to work with PostgreSQL's Row Level Security, provisioned behind an API gateway with key-auth enabled.
- **Fast.** <br />Our benchmarks for basic reads are more than 300% faster than Firebase. The API is a very thin layer on top of Postgres, which does most of the heavy lifting.
- **Scalable.** <br />The API can serve thousands of simultaneous requests, and works well for Serverless workloads.

## REST API [#rest-api-overview]

Supabase provides a RESTful API using [PostgREST](https://postgrest.org/). This is a very thin API layer on top of Postgres.
It provides everything you need from a CRUD API:

- Basic CRUD operations
- Deeply nested joins, allowing you to fetch data from multiple tables in a single fetch
- Works with Postgres Views
- Works with Postgres Functions
- Works with the Postgres security model - including Row Level Security, Roles, and Grants.

## GraphQL API [#graphql-api-overview]

<Admonition type='note'>

GraphQL is in Beta, and may have breaking changes. It is only available on self-hosted setups and Supabase projects created after 28th March 2022.

</Admonition>

GraphQL in Supabase works through [pg_graphql](https://supabase.com/blog/pg-graphql), an open source PostgreSQL extension for GraphQL.

## Realtime API [#realtime-api-overview]

Supabase provides a Realtime API using [Realtime](https://github.com/supabase/realtime). You can use this to listen to database changes over websockets.
Realtime leverages PostgreSQL's built-in logical replication. You can manage your Realtime API simply by managing Postgres publications.
Go to your project's [Replication section](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/database/replication) to get started.

## Getting started

All APIs are auto-created from Database tables. After you have added tables or functions to your database, you can use the APIs provided.

### Creating API Routes

API routes are automatically created when you create Postgres Tables, Views, or Functions.

Let's create our first
API route by creating a table called `todos` to store tasks.
This creates a corresponding route `todos` which can accept `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, & `DELETE` requests.

<Tabs
  scrollable
  size="small"
  type="underlined"
  defaultActiveId="dashboard"
>
<TabPanel id="dashboard" label="Dashboard">

1. Go to the [Table editor](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/editor) page in the Dashboard.
1. Click **New Table** and create a table with the name `todos`.
1. Click **Save**.
1. Click **New Column** and create a column with the name `task` and type `text`.
1. Click **Save**.

create table
  todos (
    id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
    task text check (char_length(task) > 3)
  );
```

</TabPanel>
</Tabs>

### API URL and Keys

Every Supabase project has a unique API URL. Your API is secured behind an API gateway which requires an API Key for every request.

1. Go to the [Settings](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/settings/general) page in the Dashboard.
2. Click **API** in the sidebar.
3. Find your API `URL`, `anon`, and `service_role` keys on this page.

<video width="99%" muted playsInline controls="true">
  <source
    src="https://xguihxuzqibwxjnimxev.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/videos/docs/api/api-url-and-key.mp4"
    type="video/mp4"
    muted
    playsInline
  />
</video>

The REST API and the GraphQL API are both accessible through this URL:

- REST: `https://<project_ref>.supabase.co/rest/v1`
- GraphQL: `https://<project_ref>.supabase.co/graphql/v1`

Both of these routes require the `anon` key to be passed through an `apikey` header.

#### API Keys

You are provided with two keys:

- an `anon` key, which is safe to be used in a browser context.
- a `service_role` key, which should only be used on a server. This key can bypass Row Level Security. NEVER use this key in a browser.

### Accessing the docs in the Dashboard

#### REST API [#rest-api-dashboard-docs]

Supabase generates documentation in the [Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com) which updates as you make database changes.
Let's view the documentation for a `countries` table which we created in our database.

1. Go to the [API](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/api) page in the Dashboard.
2. Find the `countries` table under **Tables and Views** in the sidebar.
3. Switch between the JavaScript and the cURL docs using the tabs.

#### GraphQL

The GraphQL Endpoint that we provide (`https://<project_ref>.supabase.co/graphql/v1`) is compatible with any GraphiQL implementation that can pass an `apikey` header.
Some suggested applications:

- [paw.cloud](https://paw.cloud)
- [insomnia.rest](https://insomnia.rest)
- [postman.com/graphql](https://www.postman.com/graphql/)
- Self-hosted GraphiQL: GraphiQL can be served through a simple HTML file. See [this discussion](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/discussions/6144) for more details.

## Using the API

### REST API

You can interact with your API directly via HTTP requests, or you can use the client libraries which we provide.

Let's see how to make a request to the `todos` table which we created in the first step,
using the API URL (`SUPABASE_URL`) and Key (`SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`) we provided:

<Tabs
  scrollable
  size="small"
  type="underlined"
  defaultActiveId="javascript"
>
<TabPanel id="javascript" label="Javascript">

```javascript
// Initialize the JS client
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'
const supabase = createClient(SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY)

// Make a request
const { data: todos, error } = await supabase.from('todos').select('*')
```

</TabPanel>
<TabPanel id="curl" label="cURL">

```bash
# Append /rest/v1/ to your URL, and then use the table name as the route
curl '<SUPABASE_URL>/rest/v1/todos' \
-H "apikey: <SUPABASE_ANON_KEY>" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <SUPABASE_ANON_KEY>"
```

</TabPanel>
</Tabs>

JS Reference: [select()](/docs/reference/javascript/select),
[insert()](/docs/reference/javascript/insert),
[update()](/docs/reference/javascript/update),
[upsert()](/docs/reference/javascript/upsert),
[delete()](/docs/reference/javascript/delete),
[rpc()](/docs/reference/javascript/rpc) (call Postgres functions).

### GraphQL API

You can use any GraphQL client with the Supabase GraphQL API. For our GraphQL example we will use [urql](https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/docs/).

<Tabs
  scrollable
  size="small"
  type="underlined"
  defaultActiveId="javascript"
>
<TabPanel id="javascript" label="Javascript">

```javascript
import { createClient, useQuery } from 'urql'

// Prepare API key and Authorization header
const headers = {
  apikey: <SUPABASE_ANON_KEY>,
  authorization: `Bearer ${<SUPABASE_ANON_KEY>}`,
}

// Create GraphQL client
// See: https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/docs/basics/react-preact/#setting-up-the-client
const client = createClient({
  url: '<SUPABASE_URL>/graphql/v1',
  fetchOptions: function createFetchOptions() {
    return { headers }
  },
})

// Prepare our GraphQL query
const TodosQuery = `
  query {
    todosCollection {
      edges {
        node {
          id
          title
        }
      }
    }
  }
`

// Query for the data (React)
const [result, reexecuteQuery] = useQuery({
  query: TodosQuery,
})

// Read the result
const { data, fetching, error } = result
```

</TabPanel>
<TabPanel id="curl" label="cURL">

```bash
# Append /graphql/v1/ to your URL, and then use the table name as the route
curl --request POST '<SUPABASE_URL>/graphql/v1' \
-H 'apikey: <SUPABASE_ANON_KEY>' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <SUPABASE_ANON_KEY>' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{ "query":"{ todos(first: 3) { edges { node { id } } } }" }'
```

</TabPanel>
</Tabs>

### Realtime API

By default Realtime is disabled on your database. Let's turn on Realtime for the `todos` table.

<Tabs
  scrollable
  size="small"
  type="underlined"
  defaultActiveId="dashboard"
>
<TabPanel id="dashboard" label="Dashboard">

1. Go to the [Database](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/database/tables) page in the Dashboard.
2. Click on **Replication** in the sidebar.
3. Control which database events are sent by toggling **Insert**, **Update**, and **Delete**.
4. Control which tables broadcast changes by selecting **Source** and toggling each table.

<video width="99%" muted playsInline controls="true">
  <source
    src="https://xguihxuzqibwxjnimxev.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/videos/docs/api/api-realtime.mp4"
    type="video/mp4"
    muted
    playsInline
  />
</video>

</TabPanel>
<TabPanel id="sql" label="SQL">

```sql
alter
  publication supabase_realtime add table todos;
```

</TabPanel>
</Tabs>

From the client, we can listen to any new data that is inserted into the `todos` table:

```javascript
// Initialize the JS client
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'
const supabase = createClient(SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY)

// Create a function to handle inserts
const handleInserts = (payload) => {
  console.log('Change received!', payload)
}

// Listen to inserts
const { data: todos, error } = await supabase.from('todos').on('INSERT', handleInserts).subscribe()
```

Use [subscribe()](/docs/reference/javascript/subscribe) to listen to database changes.
The Realtime API works through PostgreSQL's replication functionality. Postgres sends database changes to a [publication](/docs/guides/database/replication#publications)
called `supabase_realtime`, and by managing this publication you can control which data is broadcast.
