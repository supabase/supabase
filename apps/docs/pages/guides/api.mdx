Supabase auto-generates three types of API directly from your database schema.

- REST - connect to your database through a restful interface, directly from the browser.
- GraphQL - manipulate your database using a graph-like query language.
- Realtime - listen to database changes.

All the APIs are auto-generated from your database and are designed to get you building as fast as possible, without writing a single line of code.

You can use them directly from the browser (two-tier architecture), or as a complement to your own API server (three-tier architecture).

## Features

- **Instant and auto-generated.** <br />As you update your database the changes are immediately accessible through your API.
- **Self documenting.** <br />Supabase generates documentation in the Dashboard which updates as you make database changes.
- **Secure.** <br />The API is configured to work with PostgreSQL's Row Level Security, provisioned behind an API gateway with key-auth enabled.
- **Fast.** <br />Our benchmarks for basic reads are more than 300% faster than Firebase. The API is a very thin layer on top of Postgres, which does most of the heavy lifting.
- **Scalable.** <br />The API can serve thousands of simultaneous requests, and works well for Serverless workloads.

## REST API [#rest-api-overview]

Supabase provides a RESTful API using [PostgREST](https://postgrest.org/). This is a very thin API layer on top of Postgres.
It provides everything you need from a CRUD API at the URL `https://<project_ref>.supabase.co/rest/v1/`.

The REST interface is automatically reflected from your database's schema and supports:

- Basic CRUD operations (Create/Read/Update/Delete)
- Arbitrarily deep relationships among tables/views, functions that return table types can also nest related tables/views.
- Works with Postgres Views, Materialized Views and Foreign Tables
- Works with Postgres Functions
- User defined computed columns and computed relationships
- Works with the Postgres security model - including Row Level Security, Roles, and Grants.

The REST API resolves all requests to a single SQL statement leading to fast response times and high throughput.

## GraphQL API [#graphql-api-overview]

Supabase uses [pg_graphql](https://supabase.github.io/pg_graphql/) to expose a GraphQL API endpoint at `https://<project_ref>.supabase.co/graphql/v1/`.
You can introspect and query the GraphQL API of an existing Supabase project within Studio [here](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/api/graphiql),
or navigate there manually at `API Docs > GraphQL > GraphiQL`.

The GraphQL interface is automatically reflected from your database's schema and supports:

- Basic CRUD operations (Create/Read/Update/Delete)
- Support for Tables, Views, Materialized Views, and Foreign Tables
- Arbitrarily deep relationships among tables/views
- User defined computed fields
- The Postgres security model - including Row Level Security, Roles, and Grants.

The GraphQL API resolves all requests in a single round-trip leading to fast response times and high throughput.

## Realtime API [#realtime-api-overview]

Supabase provides a Realtime API using [Realtime](https://github.com/supabase/realtime). You can use this to listen to database changes over websockets.
Realtime leverages PostgreSQL's built-in logical replication. You can manage your Realtime API simply by managing Postgres publications.
Go to your project's [Replication section](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/database/replication) to get started.

## API URL and Keys

You can find the API URL and Keys in the [Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/api).
