## Prerequisites

Make sure you have these installed on your local machine:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
- [Supabase CLI](/docs/guides/cli)

## Log in to the Supabase CLI

```bash
supabase login
```

<Admonition type="note">

If you installed the Supabase CLI via NPM you may have to use `npx supabase login`.
	
</Admonition>


## Initialize your project

Create a new folder for your project and start a new git repository:

```bash
# create your project folder
mkdir your-project

# move into the new folder
cd your-project

# start a new git repository
git init
```

## Start Supabase services

[Initialize](/docs/reference/cli/usage#supabase-init) Supabase to set up the configuration for developing your project locally:

```bash
supabase init
```

Make sure Docker is running. The [start](/docs/reference/cli/usage#supabase-start) command uses Docker to start the Supabase [services](/docs/guides/getting-started/architecture).
This command may take a while to run if this is the first time using the CLI.

```bash
supabase start
```

Once all of the Supabase services are running, you'll see output containing your local Supabase credentials.
You can use the [stop](/docs/reference/cli/usage#supabase-stop) command at any time to stop all services.

## Access services

You can access services directly with any Postgres client or through the API Gateway ([Kong](https://github.com/Kong/kong)).

  type="underlined"
  defaultActiveId="postgres"
>
<TabPanel id="postgres" label="Postgres">

```sh
# Default URL:
postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54322/postgres
```

The local Postgres instance can be accessed through [`psql`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html)
or any other Postgres client, such as [pgadmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/).

For example:

```bash
psql 'postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54322/postgres'
```

<Admonition type="note">

To access the database from an edge function in your local Supabase setup, replace `localhost` with `host.docker.internal`.

</Admonition>

</TabPanel>
<TabPanel id="kong" label="API Gateway">

```sh
# Default URL:
http://localhost:54321
```

If you are accessing these services without the client libraries, you may need to pass the client keys as an `Authorization` header.
Learn more about [JWT headers](/docs/learn/auth-deep-dive/auth-deep-dive-jwts).

```sh
curl 'http://localhost:54321/rest/v1/' \
    -H "apikey: <anon key>" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <anon key>"

http://localhost:54321/rest/v1/           # REST (PostgREST)
http://localhost:54321/realtime/v1/       # Realtime
http://localhost:54321/storage/v1/        # Storage
http://localhost:54321/auth/v1/           # Auth (GoTrue)
```

<Admonition type="note">

`<anon key>` is provided when you run the command `supabase start`.

## Database migrations

Database changes are managed through "migrations." Database migrations are a common way of tracking changes to your database over time.

  ></iframe>
</div>

### Make database changes

For this guide, create a table called `employees`. In Supabase Studio, navigate to the **SQL Editor** page and run the following SQL command:

```sql
create table employees (
	id integer primary key generated always as identity,
	name text
);
```

<Admonition type="note">

You can execute any SQL using the `DB URL` shown by [`supabase status`](/docs/reference/cli/usage#supabase-status).

</Admonition>

Run the [`db diff`](/docs/reference/cli/usage#supabase-db-diff) command to detect changes in the local database:

```sh
supabase db diff create_employees -f create_employees
```

This creates a new migration named `supabase/migrations/<timestamp>_create_employees.sql`, representing any changes made to the local database since [`supabase start`](/docs/reference/cli/usage#supabase-start).

### Add sample data

Use the seed script in `supabase/seed.sql` (created with [`supabase init`](/docs/reference/cli/usage#supabase-init)) to add sample data to the table.

```sql
-- in supabase/seed.sql
insert into public.employees (name)
values
  ('Erlich Bachman'),
  ('Richard Hendricks'),
  ('Monica Hall');
```

Rerun the migration and seed scripts:

```bash
supabase db reset
```

You should now see the contents of `employees` in Studio.

### Reset database changes

Use the [`reset`](/docs/reference/cli/usage#supabase-db-reset) command to revert any changes to the local database.

```sql
-- run on local database to make a change
alter table employees
  add department text default 'Hooli';
```

Run the following command to reset the local database:

```sh
supabase db reset
```

## Deploy your project

Go to the [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com) and create a project to deploy the changes.

### Link your project

<Admonition type="note">

There are a few commands required to link your project. We are in the process of consolidating these commands into a single command. Bear with us!

</Admonition>

Associate your project with your remote project using [`supabase link`](/docs/reference/cli/usage#supabase-link).

```bash
supabase link --project-ref <project-id>
# You can get <project-id> from your project’s dashboard URL: https://app.supabase.com/project/<project-id>

supabase db remote commit
# Capture any changes that you have made to your database before setting up the CLI
```

`supabase/migrations` is now populated with a migration in `..._remote_commit.sql`.
This migration captures any changes required for your local database to match the schema of your remote Supabase project.

### Deploy database changes

Deploy any local database migrations using [`db push`](/docs/reference/cli/usage#supabase-db-push):

```sh
supabase db push
```

### Deploy Edge Functions

Deploy any Edge Functions using [`functions deploy`](/docs/reference/cli/usage#supabase-functions-deploy):

```sh
supabase functions deploy <function_name>
```

## Limitations

The local development environment is not as feature-complete as the Supabase Platform. Here are some of the differences:

- The Functions interface is coming soon.
- Logs are not supported through the interface (however you can access them through the Docker containers).
- You cannot update your project settings in the Dashboard—this must be done using the CLI.
