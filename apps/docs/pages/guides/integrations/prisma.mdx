}

This guide explains how to quickly connect the Postgres database provided by Supabase to a Prisma project.

[Prisma](https://prisma.io) is an [open source](https://github.com/prisma/prisma) next-generation ORM. It consists of the following parts:

- **Prisma Client**: Auto-generated and type-safe query builder for Node.js & TypeScript.
- **Prisma Migrate**: Migration system.
- **Prisma Studio**: GUI to view and edit data in your database.

## Step 1: Get the connection string from Supabase project settings

Go to the settings page from the sidebar and navigate to the **Database** tab. You’ll find the database’s connection string with a placeholder for the password you provided when you created the project.

## Step 2: Testing the connection

To make sure that everything works correctly, let’s try the connection string in a Prisma project.

If you already have one, all you need to do is set the `DATABASE_URL` to the connection string (including the password) in your `.env` file, and you’re good to go.

In case you don’t have a Prisma project or this is your first time working with Prisma, you’re going to use the repo from the [quickstart](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/quickstart) guide.

### Cloning the starter project

Navigate into a directory of your choice and run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
curl https://codeload.github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/tar.gz/latest | tar -xz --strip=2 prisma-examples-latest/databases/postgresql-supabase
```

You can now navigate into the directory and install the project’s dependencies:

```bash
cd postgresql-supabase
npm install
```

### A look at the project’s structure

This project comes with TypeScript configured and has the following structure.

- A `prisma` directory which contains:
  - A `seed.ts` file: This is the data used to seed your database.
  - A `schema.prisma` file: Where you define the different database models and relations between them.
- A `script.ts` file: where you will run some queries using Prisma Client.

This starter also comes with the following packages installed:
- [`@prisma/client`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@prisma/client): An auto-generated and type-safe query builder that’s _tailored_ to your data.
- [`prisma`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prisma): Prisma’s command-line interface (CLI). It allows you to initialize new project assets, generate Prisma Client, and analyze existing database structures through introspection to automatically create your application models.

> Note: Prisma works with both JavaScript and TypeScript. However, to get the best possible development experience, using TypeScript is highly recommended.

### Configuring the project

Create a `.env` file at the root of your project:

```bash
touch .env
```

In the `.env` file, add a `DATABASE_URL` variable and add the connection string from **step 1**. The `.env` file should look like:

```bash .env
DATABASE_URL="postgres://postgres:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@db.[YOUR-PROJECT-REF].supabase.co:5432/postgres"
```

This is what your `schema.prisma` file should look like:

```go
datasource db {
  provider          = "postgresql"
  url               = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

model Post {
  id        Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  title     String
  content   String?
  published Boolean @default(false)
  author    User?   @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId  Int?
}

model User {
  id    Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  email String  @unique
  name  String?
  posts Post[]
}
```


To test that everything works correctly, run the following command to create a migration:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

You can optionally give your migration a name, depending on the changes you made. Since this is the project’s first migration, you’re setting the `--name` flag to “init”. If everything works correctly, you should get the following message in your terminal:

```text
Your database is now in sync with your schema.
:heavy_check_mark: Generated Prisma Client (4.x.x) to ./node_modules/@prisma/client in 111ms
```

This will create a `prisma/migrations` folder inside your `prisma` directory and synchronize your Prisma schema with your database schema.

> **Note**: If you want to skip the process of creating a migration history, you can use the [`prisma db push`](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-migrate/db-push) command instead of `prisma migrate dev`. However, we recommend using `prisma migrate dev` to evolve your database schema in development.
> If you would like to get a conceptual overview of how Prisma Migrate works and which commands to use in what environment, refer to [this page in the Prisma documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-migrate/mental-model).

If you go to your Supabase project, in the table editor, you should see that two tables have been created, a `Post`, `User`, and `_prisma_migrations` tables. The `_prisma_migrations` table is used to keep track of the migration history and ensure that the database schema stays in sync with your Prisma schema.

![tables created in the UI](/docs/img/guides/integrations/prisma/7y4qq4wwvfrheti6r09u.png)

That’s it! You have now successfully connected a Prisma project to a PostgreSQL database hosted on Supabase and ran your first migration.

## Connection pooling with Supabase

If you’re working in a serverless environment (for example Node.js functions hosted on AWS Lambda, Vercel or Netlify Functions), you need to set up [connection pooling](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/performance-and-optimization/connection-management#serverless-environments-faas) using a tool like [PgBouncer](https://www.pgbouncer.org/). That’s because every function invocation may result in a [new connection to the database](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/performance-and-optimization/connection-management#the-serverless-challenge). 

Supabase [supports connection management using PgBouncer](/docs/guides/database/connecting-to-postgres#connection-pool) which prevents a traffic spike from overwhelming your database. 

Go to the **Database** page from the sidebar in the Supabase dashboard and navigate to **Connection pool** settings:

![Connection pool settings](/docs/img/guides/integrations/prisma/w0oowg8vq435ob5c3gf0.png)

When updating your database schema, you need to use the non-pooled connection URL (like the one used in **step 1**). You can configure the non-pooled connection string by using the `directUrl` property in the datasource block.

Update your `.env` file with the following changes:
1. Rename the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to `DIRECT_URL`
1. Create a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable and paste in the new connection string from the dashboard as its value

Append the `?pgbouncer=true` flag to the `DATABASE_URL` variable.

Your `.env` file should resemble the following:

```bash .env
# PostgreSQL connection string used for migrations
DIRECT_URL="postgres://postgres:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@db.[YOUR-PROJECT-REF].supabase.co:5432/postgres"

# PostgreSQL connection string with pgBouncer config — used by Prisma Client
DATABASE_URL="postgres://postgres:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@db.[YOUR-PROJECT-REF].supabase.co:6543/postgres?pgbouncer=true"
```

Update your Prisma schema by setting the `directUrl` in the datasource block:

```go
datasource db {
  provider          = "postgresql"
  url               = env("DATABASE_URL")
  directUrl         = env("DIRECT_URL")
}
```

> **Note**: This feature is available from Prisma version [4.10.0](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/4.10.0) and higher.

## Troubleshooting

### Missing grants

If your database schema is out of sync from your migration history, `prisma migrate dev` will detect a migration history conflict or a [schema drift](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/database/developing-with-prisma-migrate/troubleshooting-development#schema-drift). When `prisma migrate dev` detects the drift, it might ask to to reset your database schema. If you choose yes, it will delete the `public` schema along with the default grants defined in your database.

If you run into this problem, create a draft migration using `prisma migrate dev --create-only`, and add the following helper SQL:

```sql
grant usage on schema public to postgres, anon, authenticated, service_role;

grant all privileges on all tables in schema public to postgres, anon, authenticated, service_role;
grant all privileges on all functions in schema public to postgres, anon, authenticated, service_role;
grant all privileges on all sequences in schema public to postgres, anon, authenticated, service_role;

alter default privileges in schema public grant all on tables to postgres, anon, authenticated, service_role;
alter default privileges in schema public grant all on functions to postgres, anon, authenticated, service_role;
alter default privileges in schema public grant all on sequences to postgres, anon, authenticated, service_role;
```

Run `prisma migrate dev` to apply the draft migration to the database.

### Using Supabase Auth with Prisma

If you would like to use Supabase Auth and Prisma in your application, you will have to enable the `multiSchema` Preview feature flag in the `generator` block of your Prisma schema:

```go
datasource db {
  provider          = "postgresql"
  url               = env("DATABASE_URL")
  directUrl         = env("DIRECT_URL")
}

generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["multiSchema"]
}
```

Next, specify the database schemas you would like to include in your Prisma schema:

```go
datasource db {
  provider          = "postgresql"
  url               = env("DATABASE_URL")
  directUrl         = env("DIRECT_URL")
  schemas           = ["public", "auth"]
}

generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["multiSchema"]
}
```

You can then specify what schema a model or enum belongs to using the `@@schema` attribute:

```go
model User {
  id     Int     @id
  // ...

  @@schema("auth") // or @@schema("public")
}
```

### Using PostgreSQL Row Level Security with Prisma


If you would like to use Row Level Security (RLS) with Prisma, check out the [Prisma Client Extension - Row Level Security example](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-client-extensions/tree/main/row-level-security) that provides the primitives you could use to build and extend Prisma Client in PostgreSQL.

Also check out [useSupabaseRowLevelSecurity](https://github.com/dthyresson/prisma-extension-supabase-rls) Prisma Client extension that supports [Supabase RLS](/docs/guides/auth/row-level-security#authrole) and policies written to use [Supabase auth](/docs/guides/auth/overview).

The example and extension use [Prisma Client extensions](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/client-extensions) Preview feature.

### Enabling PosgreSQL extensions

If you would like to use a PostgreSQL extension with Prisma, enable the `postgresqlExtensions` Preview feature flag in the `generator` block of your Prisma schema:

```go
datasource db {
  provider          = "postgresql"
  url               = env("DATABASE_URL")
  directUrl         = env("DIRECT_URL")
}

generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["postgresqlExtensions"]
}
```

Next, specify the extensions you need in the `datasource` block:

```go
datasource db {
  provider          = "postgresql"
  url               = env("DATABASE_URL")
  directUrl         = env("DIRECT_URL")
  extensions        = [hstore(schema: "myHstoreSchema"), pg_trgm, postgis(version: "2.1")]
}

generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["postgresqlExtensions"]
}
```

To learn more about using Prisma with PostgreSQL extensions, refer to [this page in the Prisma docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-schema/postgresql-extensions).
