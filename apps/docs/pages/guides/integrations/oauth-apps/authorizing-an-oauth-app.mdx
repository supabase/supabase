## Overview

This guide steps through implementing **Sign-in with Supabase**. Once you've added OAuth2.0 support to your main application, you will receive an access and refresh token from your users that choose to **Sign in with Supabase** on your application.

The access token returned will grant your application full access to the [Management API](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/api/introduction) on behalf of the user.

## Implement the OAuth 2.0 flow

Once you've published your OAuth App on Supabase, you can use the OAuth 2.0 protocol to seek consent from Supabase users to access their organization or project.

1. Call the [`GET /v1/oauth/authorize`](<https://api.supabase.com/api/v1#/oauth%20(beta)/authorize>) endpoint. This should redirect the user to a consent screen where they can select the organization that they want to grant access to.

   > Note: `redirect_uri` and `state` combined must not be larger than 4kB. PKCE is strongly recommended for security reasons.

2. Ensure that your application server has implemented the endpoint listed in the "Authorization callback URLs". After the user consents to your application receiving access, your application server will receive a `GET` request on the provided `redirect_uri` in the previous step. This `redirect_uri` will contain the following query parameters:

   `code` : A unique authorization code you can exchange for a Supabase access and refresh token.

   `state` : (Optional) The state you passed to the [`GET /v1/oauth/authorize`](<https://api.supabase.com/api/v1#/oauth%20(beta)/authorize>) endpoint previously.

3. Extract these query parameters and exchange the `code` using the [`POST /v1/oauth/token`](<https://api.supabase.com/api/v1#/oauth%20(beta)/token>) endpoint.

4. An access token and refresh token will be returned if the request is successful.

## Refresh an access token

You can use the [`POST /v1/oauth/token`](<https://api.supabase.com/api/v1#/oauth%20(beta)/token>) endpoint to refresh an access token using the refresh token returned at the end of the previous section.

If the user has revoked access to your application, you will not be able to refresh a token. Furthermore, access tokens will stop working. Make sure you handle HTTP Unauthorized errors when calling any Supabase API.

## Access the Management API using the access token

Refer to [this section](/docs/reference/api/introduction#authentication) to learn more about authentication with the Management API.
