## Overview

This guide steps through implementing "Sign-in with Supabase". You can create and register an OAuth app under your organization. Once you've added OAuth2.0 support to your main application, you will receive an access and refresh token from the users that "Sign in with Supabase" through your application.
This access token returned will grant your application full access to the [Management API](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/api/introduction) on behalf of the user.

## Creating an OAuth App

1. In your organization's settings, navigate to the [**OAuth Apps**](https://app.supabase.com/org/_/apps) tab.
2. In the upper-right section of the page, click **Add application**.
3. In "Application name", fill in the name of your OAuth app.
4. In your website URL, fill in the URL of the app that's using the OAuth app.
5. Upload a logo for your OAuth app.
6. In "Authorization callback URLs", add the callback URL of your app.
7. At the bottom of the page, click **Confirm**.
