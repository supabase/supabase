}

It's important to know which version of PostgreSQL you are running, since each major version has different features and may cause breaking changes. If [upgrading](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgupgrade.html) or downgrading a major Postgres version, you may need to update your schema.

From the [SQL editor](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/sql) you can run the simple query:

```sql
select version();
```

Which should return something like:

```sql
PostgreSQL 15.1 on aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu, compiled by gcc (Ubuntu 10.3.0-1ubuntu1~20.04) 10.3.0, 64-bit
```

This query can also be executed via psql or any other query editor if you prefer to [connect directly to the database](/docs/guides/database/connecting-to-postgres#direct-connections).
