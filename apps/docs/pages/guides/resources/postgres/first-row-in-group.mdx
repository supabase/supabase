Given a table `seasons`:

| id   |      team      |  points |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
| 1 |  Liverpool | 82 |
| 2 |    Liverpool   |   84 |
| 3 | Brighton |    34 |
| 4 | Brighton |    28 |
| 5 | Liverpool |    79 |

We want to find the rows containing the maximum number of points *per team*.

The expected output we want is:

| id   |      team      |  points |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
| 3 |    Brighton   |   34 |
| 2 | Liverpool |    84 |

From the [SQL editor](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/sql) you can run a query like:

```sql
select distinct on (team)
       id, team, points
from   seasons
order  BY id, points desc, team;
```

The important bits here are the `desc` that we put on the ordering of `points` which ranks the points in descending value (starting with the highest). And the `distinct` keyword that tells Postgres to only return a single row per team.

This query can also be executed via psql or any other query editor if you prefer to [connect directly to the database](/docs/guides/database/connecting-to-postgres#direct-connections).
