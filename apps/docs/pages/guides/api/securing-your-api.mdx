}

The Serverless APIs are designed to work with Postgres Row Level Security (RLS). If you use [Supabase Auth](/docs/guides/auth), you can restrict data based on the logged-in user.
To control access to your data, you can use [Policies](/docs/guides/auth#policies).

## Enabling Row Level Security

If you create a table through the Dashboard, RLS will be enabled by default. This is not the case, however, if you create a table or view using SQL.
To enable RLS on any table:

<Tabs
  scrollable
  size="small"
  type="underlined"
  defaultActiveId="dashboard"
>
<TabPanel id="dashboard" label="Dashboard">

1. Go to the [Authentication](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/users) page in the Dashboard.
2. Click on **Policies** in the sidebar.
3. Select **Enable RLS** to enable Row Level Security.

</TabPanel>
<TabPanel id="sql" label="SQL">

```sql
alter table
  todos enable row level security;
```

</TabPanel>
</Tabs>

With RLS enabled, you can create Policies that allow or disallow users to access and update data. We provide a detailed guide for creating Row Level Security Policies in our [Authorization documentation](/docs/guides/auth/row-level-security).

## Safeguards towards accidental deletes and updates

By default, all projects have the [safeupdate](https://github.com/eradman/pg-safeupdate) Postgres extension enabled for API queries.
This ensures that `delete()` and `update()` requests will fail if there are no filters provided.
To confirm that safeupdate is enabled for API queries, run the following query:

```sql
select
  usename,
  useconfig
from pg_shadow
where usename = 'authenticator';
```

The expected value for `useconfig` should be:

```sql
['session_preload_libraries=supautils, safeupdate']
```
