All assets uploaded to Supabase Storage are cached on a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to improve the latency for users all around the world. CDNs are a geographically distributed set of servers or **nodes** which caches content from an **origin server**. For Supabase Storage, the origin is the storage server running in the [same region as your project](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/settings/general). Aside from performance, CDNs also help with security and availability by mitigating Distributed Denial of Service and other application attacks.

## Basic CDN - TTL Caching

### Example

Letâ€™s walk through an example of how a CDN helps with performance.

A new bucket is created for a Supabase project launched in Singapore. All requests to the Supabase Storage API first hit the CDN.

A user from the United States requests an object and is routed to the U.S. CDN. At this point, that CDN node does not have the object in its cache and pings the origin server in Singapore. Another user, also in the United States, requests the same object and is served directly from the CDN cache in the United States instead of routing the request back to Singapore.

### Cache duration

By default, assets are cached both in the CDN and in the user's browser for 1 hour.

After this, the CDN nodes ping the storage server to see if an object has been updated. You can modify this cache time when you are [uploading](/docs/reference/javascript/storage-from-upload) or [updating](/docs/reference/javascript/storage-from-update) an object by modifying the `cacheControl` parameter.
If you expect the object to not change at a given URL, setting a longer cache duration is preferable.

If you need to update the version of the object stored in the CDN, there are various cache-busting techniques you can use.<br /> The most common way to do this is to add a version query parameter in the URL.

For example, you can use a URL like `/storage/v1/object/sign/profile-pictures/cat.jpg?token=eyJh...&version=1` in your applications and set a long cache time of 1 year.

When you want to update the cat picture, you can increment the version query parameter in the URL. The CDN will treat `/storage/v1/object/sign/profile-pictures/cat.jpg?token=eyJh...&version=2` as a new object and pings the origin for the updated version.

Note that CDNs might still evict your object from their cache if it has not been requested for a while from a specific region. For example, if no user from United States requests your object, it will be removed from the CDN cache even if you set a very long cache control duration.

The cache status of a particular request is sent in the `cf-cache-status` header. A cache status of `MISS` indicates that the CDN node did not have the object in its cache and had to ping the origin to get it. A cache status of `HIT` indicates that the object was sent directly from the CDN.


## Smart CDN Caching

With Smart CDN caching enabled, we are synchronizing the asset metadata (not the content) that live in your database to the edge.
By doing this we are able to automatically revalidate the cache when the content of an asset changes or gets deleted.

On top of automatic revalidation, you will also benefit from a much greater Cache HIT ratio, since we are able to shield the origin server when
requesting an asset that hasn't changed when using different query string url.

### Cache duration

When using Smart CDN, we will control the CDN cache duration on the server and caching it for as long as possible.
However, you are still in control of the browser caching TTL which you can set by using the [cacheControl](/docs/reference/javascript/storage-from-upload) option while uploading the file.

When a file is updated or deleted, we will automatically invalidate the CDN cache to reflect the change as well as to all derivatives (transformed images).
Keep in mind that the invalidation can take <b>up to 60 seconds</b> to be propagated across all the data-centers across the globe.

When we invalidate an asset at the CDN level, it can't, doesn't, affect browser caching.
If you don't see the reflected changes make sure the browser cache has been updated.

If your asset is updated frequently we recommend setting a low browser ttl value using the `cacheControl` option when using smart cdn caching.

Smart CDN caching works with all types of operations including signed urls.


## Public vs Private Buckets

Objects in public buckets do not require any Authorization to access objects. This leads to a better cache hit rate compared to private buckets. For private buckets, permissions for accessing each object is checked on a per user level. For example, if two different users access the same object in a private bucket from the same region, it results in a cache miss for both the users since they might have different security policies attached to them. On the other hand, if two different users access the same object in a public bucket from the same region, it results in a cache hit for the second user.
