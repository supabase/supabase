Supabase Storage is designed to work perfectly with [Postgres Row Level Security](/docs/guides/database/postgres/row-level-security) (RLS).

You can use RLS to create [Security Access Policies](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createpolicy.html) that are incredibly powerful and flexible, allowing you to restrict access based on your business needs.

## Policies

Policies are just SQL, and they're easy once you get the hang of them. For example, here is a Policy that allows public access to any files in a bucket called "my_bucket_id".

```sql
create policy "Public Access"
on storage.objects
for select                              -- Allow read access
to anon, authenticated                  -- Allow access to anonymous and authenticated users
using ( bucket_id = 'my_bucket_id' );   -- Identify the bucket
```

An easy way to get started would be to create RLS policies for `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` operations and restrict the policies to meet your security requirements. For example, one can start with the following `INSERT` policy:

```sql
create policy "policy_name"
ON storage.objects
for insert using (
  true
);
```

and modify it to only allow authenticated users to upload assets to a specific bucket by changing it to:

```sql
create policy "policy_name"
on storage.objects for insert to authenticated using (
    -- restrict bucket
    bucket_id = 'my_bucket_id'
);
```

## Metadata storage

Supabase Storage stores metadata in the `objects` and `buckets` table in the storage schema.

To allow read access to files, the RLS policy must allow users to `SELECT` the `objects` table and for uploading a new object, the RLS policy must grant users access to `INSERT` into the `objects` table and so on. The mapping between the different API calls and the database permissions required is documented in the [Reference docs](/docs/reference/javascript/storage-createbucket).

## Public and private buckets

Storage buckets are private by default. For private buckets, you can access objects via the [download](/docs/reference/javascript/storage-from-download) method. This corresponds to `/object/auth/` API endpoint. Alternatively, you can create a publicly shareable URL with an expiry date using the [createSignedUrl](/docs/reference/javascript/storage-from-createsignedurl) method which calls the `/object/sign/` API.

For public buckets, you can access the assets directly without a token or an Authorisation header. The [getPublicUrl](/docs/reference/javascript/storage-from-getpublicurl) helper method returns the full public URL for an asset. This calls the `/object/public/` API endpoint internally. While no authorization is required for accessing objects in a public bucket, [proper access control](#policies) is required for other operations like uploading, deleting objects from public buckets as well.

Public buckets also tend to have [better performance](/docs/guides/storage-cdn#public-vs-private-buckets).

The URLs to access storage endpoints are prefixed with <code>/storage/v1</code>. For example, on the hosted Platform they will be:

<code>https://[project_ref].supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/[id]</code>

You can access the storage API directly with the same endpoint. See the <a href="https://supabase.github.io/storage-api">API docs</a> for a full list of operations available.

## Helper functions

Supabase Storage provides SQL helper functions which you can use in your database queries and RLS policies.

### `storage.filename()`

Returns the name of a file. For example, if your file is stored in `public/subfolder/avatar.png` it would return: `'avatar.png'`

**Usage**

This example demonstrates how you would allow any user to download a file called `favicon.ico`:

```sql
create policy "Allow authenticated uploads"
on storage.objects
for select
to public
using (
  storage.filename(name) = 'favicon.ico'
);
```

### `storage.foldername()`

Returns an array path, with all of the subfolders that a file belongs to. For example, if your file is stored in `public/subfolder/avatar.png` it would return: `[ 'public', 'subfolder' ]`

**Usage**

This example demonstrates how you would allow authenticated users to upload files to a folder called `private`:

```sql
create policy "Allow authenticated uploads"
on storage.objects
for insert
to authenticated
with check (
  storage.foldername(name)[1] = 'private'
);
```

### `storage.extension()`

Returns the extension of a file. For example, if your file is stored in `public/subfolder/avatar.png` it would return: `'png'`

**Usage**

This example demonstrates how you would allow restrict uploads to only PNG files inside a bucket called `cats`:

```sql
create policy "Only allow PNG uploads"
on storage.objects
for insert
to authenticated
with check (
  bucket_id = 'cats' and storage.extension(name) = 'png'
);
```

## Usage

Row Level Security is extremely versatile, since it simply uses SQL to express access rules for your data. You can learn more about RLS in the [Database docs](/docs/guides/database/postgres/row-level-security).

### Allowing public access to a bucket

Allow public access to any files in the "public" bucket:

```sql
create policy "Public Access"
on storage.objects for select
to public
using ( bucket_id = 'public' );
```

### Allowing logged-in access to a bucket

Allow logged-in access to any files in the "restricted" bucket:

```sql
create policy "Restricted Access"
on storage.objects for select
to authenticated
using ( bucket_id = 'restricted' );
```

### Allowing individual access to a file

Allow a user to access their own files:

```sql
create policy "Individual user Access"
on storage.objects for select
to authenticated
using ( auth.uid() = owner );
```
