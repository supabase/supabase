Supabase Storage is integrated with your [Postgres Database](/docs/guides/database).
This means that you can use the same [Row Level Security Policies](/docs/guides/auth#policies)
for managing access to your files. Supabase Storage stores metadata in the `objects` and `buckets` table in the storage schema.

To allow read access to files, the RLS policy must allow users to `SELECT` the `objects` table and for uploading a new object, the RLS policy must grant users access to `INSERT` into the `objects` table and so on. The mapping between the different API calls and the database permissions required is documented in the [Reference docs](/docs/reference/javascript/storage-createbucket).

<Admonition type="note">

Access control for Storage is mapped to CRUD operations on the `buckets` and `objects` table via RLS policies.

## Public and private buckets

Storage buckets are private by default. For private buckets, you can access objects via the [download](/docs/reference/javascript/storage-from-download) method. This corresponds to `/object/auth/` API endpoint.
Alternatively, you can create a publicly shareable URL with an expiry date using the [createSignedUrl](/docs/reference/javascript/storage-from-createsignedurl) method
which calls the `/object/sign/` API.

For public buckets, you can access the assets directly without a token or an Authorisation header. The [getPublicUrl](/docs/reference/javascript/storage-from-getpublicurl)
helper method returns the full public URL for an asset. This calls the `/object/public/` API endpoint internally. While no authorization is required for accessing objects in a public bucket, proper [access control](#access-control) is required for other operations like uploading, deleting objects from public buckets as well. Public buckets also tend to have [better performance](/docs/guides/storage-cdn#public-vs-private-buckets).

<details>
<summary>Advanced: reverse proxy</summary>
The URLs returned are proxied through the API Proxy. They are prefixed by <code>/storage/v1</code>.

For example, on the hosted Platform they will be

<code>https://[project_ref].supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/[id]</code>

You can access the storage API directly with the same endpoint. See the <a href="https://supabase.github.io/storage-api">API docs</a> for a full list of operations available.

## Helper functions

Supabase Storage provides SQL helper functions which you can use in your database queries and
policies.

---

#### `storage.filename()`

Returns the name of a file.

```sql
select storage.filename(name)
from storage.objects;
```

For example, if your file is stored in `public/subfolder/avatar.png` it would return:

`'avatar.png'`

---

#### `storage.foldername()`

Returns an array path, with all of the subfolders that a file belongs to.

```sql
select storage.foldername(name)
from storage.objects;
```

For example, if your file is stored in `public/subfolder/avatar.png` it would return:

`[ 'public', 'subfolder' ]`

---

#### `storage.extension()`

Returns the extension of a file.

```sql
select storage.extension(name)
from storage.objects;
```

For example, if your file is stored in `public/subfolder/avatar.png` it would return:

`'png'`

---

## Policy examples

### Allow public access to a bucket

```sql
-- 1. Allow public access to any files in the "public" bucket
create policy "Public Access"
on storage.objects for select
using ( bucket_id = 'public' );
```

### Allow logged-in access to a bucket

```sql
-- 1. Allow logged-in access to any files in the "restricted" bucket
create policy "Restricted Access"
on storage.objects for select
to authenticated
using ( bucket_id = 'restricted' );
```

### Allow individual access to a file

```sql
-- 1. Allow a user to access their own files
create policy "Individual user Access"
on storage.objects for select
using ( auth.uid() = owner );
```
