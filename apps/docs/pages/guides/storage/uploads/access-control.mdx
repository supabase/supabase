Supabase Storage is designed to work perfectly with Postgres [Row Level Security](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/postgres/row-level-security) (RLS).

You can use RLS to create Security Access Policies that are incredibly powerful and flexible, allowing you to restrict access based on your business needs.

To allow users to start uploading files you will need to setup RLS policies on the `storage.objects` table. For example, here is a Policy that allows public access to any files in a bucket called "my_bucket_id".

```sql
create policy "Public Access"
on storage.objects
for select                              -- Allow read access
to anon, authenticated                  -- Allow access to anonymous and authenticated users
using ( bucket_id = 'my_bucket_id' );   -- Identify the bucket
```

### RLS Requirements

The only RLS policy required for uploading, is to grant the `INSERT` action to the `storage.objects` table.

If you allow to overwrite files using the `upsert` functionality you will need to additionally grant `SELECT` and `UPDATE`

### RLS examples

By default Storage will not allow anonymous users or authenticated users to upload without RLS policies, that's because we take a whitelist approach other then blacklist, which has the benefit to not allow unintentional access to your objects.

An easy way to get started would be to create RLS policies for `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` operations and restrict the policies to meet your security requirements. For example, one can start with the following `INSERT` policy:

```sql
create policy "policy_name"
ON storage.objects
for insert with check (
  true
);
```

and modify it to only allow authenticated users to upload assets to a specific bucket by changing it to:

```sql
create policy "policy_name"
on storage.objects for insert to authenticated with check (
    -- restrict bucket
    bucket_id = 'my_bucket_id'
);
```

This example demonstrates how you would allow authenticated users to upload files to a folder called `private` inside `my_bucket_id`:

```sql
create policy "Allow authenticated uploads"
on storage.objects
for insert
to authenticated
with check (
  bucket_id = 'my_bucket_id' and
  storage.foldername(name)[1] = 'private'
);
```

This example demonstrates how you would allow authenticated users to upload files to a folder called with their `users.id` inside `my_bucket_id`:

```sql
create policy "Allow authenticated uploads"
on storage.objects
for insert
to authenticated
with check (
  bucket_id = 'my_bucket_id' and
  storage.foldername(name)[1] = auth.uid()
);
```

### Server Only

If you upload files on the server and you want to bypass the RLS policies you can use the `service key` as the `Authorization` header.

Remember you should not share the service key publicly.
