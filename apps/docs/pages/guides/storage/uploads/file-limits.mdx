You can customize the Max file size for file uploads.

## Global file size

You can set the max file size across all your buckets by setting this global value in the dashboard [here](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/storage).

For Free projects the limit cannot exceed 50MB. On the Pro Plan and above, you can set this value to up to 5GB.

| Plan       | Max File Size Limit |
| ---------- | ------------------- |
| Free       | 50MB                |
| Pro        | 5GB                 |
| Team       | 5GB                 |
| Enterprise | 5GB                 |

If you need more than 5GB please [contact us](https://supabase.com/dashboard/support/new).

Remember, this option is a global limit, which applies to all your buckets.
You can additionally specify the max file size on a per [bucket level](/docs/guides/storage/buckets/creating-buckets#restricting-uploads) but it cannot be higher than this global limit.

It is a good practice to have the global limit set to the highest possible file size that your application accepts, and apply per bucket limits.

## Per bucket restrictions

You can have different restrictions on a per bucket level.
You are able to restrict the file types (eg. `pdf`, `images`, `videos`) along with the max file size which should be lower than the global limit.

To apply these limit on a bucket level see [Creating Bucket](/docs/guides/storage/buckets/creating-buckets#restricting-uploads)
