Cache hits can be determined via the `metadata.response.headers.cf_cache_status` key in our [Logs Explorer](/docs/guides/platform/logs#logs-explorer). Any value that corresponds to either `HIT`, `STALE`, `REVALIDATED`, or `UPDATING` is categorized as a cache hit.
The following example query will show the top cache misses from the `edge_logs`:

```sql
select
  r.path as path,
  r.search as search,
  count(id) as count
from
  edge_logs as f
  cross join unnest(f.metadata) as m
  cross join unnest(m.request) as r
  cross join unnest(m.response) as res
  cross join unnest(res.headers) as h
where
  starts_with(r.path, '/storage/v1/object')
  and r.method = 'GET'
  and h.cf_cache_status in ('MISS', 'NONE/UNKNOWN', 'EXPIRED', 'BYPASS', 'DYNAMIC')
group by path, search
order by count desc
limit 50;
```

Your cache hit ratio over time can then be determined using the following query:

```sql
select
  timestamp_trunc(timestamp, hour) as timestamp,
  countif(h.cf_cache_status in ('HIT', 'STALE', 'REVALIDATED', 'UPDATING')) / count(f.id) as ratio
from
  edge_logs as f
  cross join unnest(f.metadata) as m
  cross join unnest(m.request) as r
  cross join unnest(m.response) as res
  cross join unnest(res.headers) as h
where starts_with(r.path, '/storage/v1/object') and r.method = 'GET'
group by timestamp
order by timestamp desc;
```
