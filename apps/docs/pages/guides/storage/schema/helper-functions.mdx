Supabase Storage provides SQL helper functions which you can use to write RLS policies.

### `storage.filename()`

Returns the name of a file. For example, if your file is stored in `public/subfolder/avatar.png` it would return: `'avatar.png'`

**Usage**

This example demonstrates how you would allow any user to download a file called `favicon.ico`:

```sql
create policy "Allow authenticated uploads"
on storage.objects
for select
to public
using (
  storage.filename(name) = 'favicon.ico'
);
```

### `storage.foldername()`

Returns an array path, with all of the subfolders that a file belongs to. For example, if your file is stored in `public/subfolder/avatar.png` it would return: `[ 'public', 'subfolder' ]`

**Usage**

This example demonstrates how you would allow authenticated users to upload files to a folder called `private`:

```sql
create policy "Allow authenticated uploads"
on storage.objects
for insert
to authenticated
with check (
  storage.foldername(name)[1] = 'private'
);
```

### `storage.extension()`

Returns the extension of a file. For example, if your file is stored in `public/subfolder/avatar.png` it would return: `'png'`

**Usage**

This example demonstrates how you would allow restrict uploads to only PNG files inside a bucket called `cats`:

```sql
create policy "Only allow PNG uploads"
on storage.objects
for insert
to authenticated
with check (
  bucket_id = 'cats' and storage.extension(name) = 'png'
);
```
