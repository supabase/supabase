Accessing the [Storage Logs](https://supabase.green/dashboard/project/__/logs/explorer?q=select+id%2C+storage_logs.timestamp%2C+event_message+from+storage_logs%0A++%0A++order+by+timestamp+desc%0A++limit+100%0A++) allows you to examine all incoming request logs to your Storage service. You can also filter logs and delve into specific aspects of your requests.

### Common Log Queries

#### Filter by status 5XX error

```sql
select id, storage_logs.timestamp, event_message, r.statusCode, e.message as errorMessage e.raw as rawError
  from storage_logs
  cross join unnest(metadata) as m
  cross join unnest(m.res) as r
  cross join unnest(m.error) as e
  where r.statusCode >= 500
  order by timestamp desc
  limit 100
```

#### Filter by status 4XX error

```sql
select id, storage_logs.timestamp, event_message, r.statusCode, e.message as errorMessage e.raw as rawError
  from storage_logs
  cross join unnest(metadata) as m
  cross join unnest(m.res) as r
  cross join unnest(m.error) as e
  where r.statusCode >= 400 and r.statusCode < 500
  order by timestamp desc
  limit 100
```

#### Filter by Method

```sql
select id, storage_logs.timestamp, event_message, r.method
from
  storage_logs
  cross join unnest(metadata) as m
  cross join unnest(m.req) as r
where r.method in ("POST")
order by timestamp desc
limit 100;
```

#### Filter by IP Address

```sql
select id, storage_logs.timestamp, event_message, r.remoteAddress
from
  storage_logs
  cross join unnest(metadata) as m
  cross join unnest(m.req) as r
where r.remoteAddress in ("IP_ADDRESS")
order by timestamp desc
limit 100;
```
