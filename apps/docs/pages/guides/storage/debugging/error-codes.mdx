Here's a list of the most common error codes and their potential resolutions:

## 404 not_found

Indicates that the resource is not found or you don't have the correct permission to access it
**Resolution:**

- Add a RLS policy to grant permission to the resource. See our [Access Control docs](/docs/guides/storage/uploads/access-control) for more information.
- Ensure you include the user `Authorization` header
- Verify the object exists

## 409 already_exists

Indicates that the resource already exists.
**Resolution:**

- Use the `upsert` functionality in order to overwrite the file. Find out more [here](/docs/guides/storage/uploads/standard-uploads#overwriting-files).

## 403 unauthorized

You don't have permission to action this request
**Resolution:**

- Add RLS policy to grant permission. See our [Access Control docs](/docs/guides/storage/uploads/access-control) for more information.
- Ensure you include the user `Authorization` header

## 429 too many requests

This problem typically arises when a large number of clients are concurrently interacting with the Storage service, and the pooler has reached its `max_clients` limit.

**Resolution:**

- Increase the max_clients limits of the pooler.
- Upgrade to a bigger project compute instance [here](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/addons).

## 544 database_timeout

This problem arises when a high number of clients are concurrently using the Storage service, and Postgres doesn't have enough available connections to efficiently handle requests to Storage.

**Resolution:**

- Increase the pool_size limits of the pooler.
- Upgrade to a bigger project compute instance [here](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/addons).

## 500 internal_server_error

This issue occurs where there is a unhandled error.
**Resolution:**
