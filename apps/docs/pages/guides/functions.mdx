Edge Functions are server-side TypeScript functions, distributed globally at the edgeâ€”close to your users. They can be used for listening to webhooks or integrating your Supabase project with third-parties [like Stripe](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/tree/master/examples/edge-functions/supabase/functions/stripe-webhooks). Edge Functions are developed using [Deno](https://deno.com), which offers a few benefits to you as a developer:

- It is open source.
- It is portable. Supabase Edge Functions run locally, and on any other Deno-compatible platform (including self-hosted infrastructure).
- It is TypeScript first and supports WASM.
- Edge Functions are globally distributed for low-latency.
