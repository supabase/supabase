To enable Discord Auth for your project, you need to set up a Discord Application and add the Application OAuth credentials to your Supabase Dashboard.

## Overview

Setting up Discord logins for your application consists of 3 parts:

- Create and configure a Discord Application [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers)
- Add your Discord OAuth Consumer keys to your [Supabase Project](https://app.supabase.com)
- Add the login code to your [Supabase JS Client App](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js)

## Access your Discord account

- Go to [discord.com](https://discord.com/).
- Click on `Login` at the top right to log in.

- Once logged in, go to [discord.com/developers](https://discord.com/developers).

## Find your callback URL

<SocialProviderSetup provider="Discord" />

## Create a Discord Application

- Click on `New Application` at the top right.
- Enter the name of your application and click `Create`.
- Click on `OAuth2` under `Settings` in the left side panel.
- Click `Add Redirect` under `Redirects`.
- Type or paste your `callback URL` into the `Redirects` box.
- Click `Save Changes` at the bottom.
- Copy your `Client ID` and `Client Secret` under `Client information`.

## Add your Discord credentials into your Supabase Project

<SocialProviderSettingsSupabase provider="Discord" />

## Add login code to your client app

When your user signs in, call [signInWithOAuth()](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signinwithoauth) with `discord` as the `provider`:

```js
async function signInWithDiscord() {
  const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({
    provider: 'discord',
  })
}
```

If your user is already signed in, Discord prompts the user again for authorization.

When your user signs out, call [signOut()](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signout) to remove them from the browser session and any objects from localStorage:

```js
async function signout() {
  const { error } = await supabase.auth.signOut()
}
```
