Supabase Auth supports Sign in with Google on the web, native Android applications and Chrome extensions.

## Overview

To support Sign in with Google you need to configure the [Google provider in the Supabase dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers) for your project.

There are three general ways to use Sign in with Google, depending on the application you're building:

- Sign in on the web or in web-based apps
  - Using an OAuth flow initiated by Supabase Auth using [Google Identity Authorization with OAuth 2.0 for Web Server Applications](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/web-server).
  - Using a [personalized sign-in button](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/personalized-button) or [One Tap](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/display-google-one-tap) and [automatic sign-in](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/automatic-sign-in-sign-out) for users already logged in to their Google account.
- Sign in in native Android apps and Chrome extensions

In some cases you're able to use the OAuth flow within web-based native apps such as with React Native, Expo or other similar frameworks. It is best practice to use native Sign in with Google capabilities whenever possible.

Before you can use Sign in with Google, you need to obtain a [Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard) account and have a project ready or create a new one.

    ## Using the OAuth flow for web

    Sign in with Google's OAuth flow is designed for web or browser based sign in methods. It can be used in web-based apps as well as in websites, though sometimes it is worthwhile considering using One Tap login directly.

    Behind the scenes, Supabase Auth uses the [Google OAuth 2.0 APIs](https://developers.google.com/identity/openid-connect/openid-connect), which are OpenID Connect certified, to perform the authentication.

    To initiate sign in, you can use the `signInWithOAuth()` method from the Supabase JavaScript library:

    ```js
    supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({
      provider: 'google',
    })
    ```

    This call takes the user to Google's consent screen. When the flow ends, the user's profile information is exchanged and validated with Supabase Auth before it redirects back to your web application with an access and refresh token representing the user's session.

    You can additionally extract the `provider_token` from the session (on initial login only) which is the OAuth 2.0 access token issued by Google that grants your application access to the Google services for the authenticated users. Please store this token in local storage, cookies or in your database or server.

    Google does not send out a refresh token by default, so you will need to pass parameters like these to `signInWithOAuth()` in order to extract the `provider_refresh_token`:

    ```js
    const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({
      provider: 'google',
      options: {
        queryParams: {
          access_type: 'offline',
          prompt: 'consent',
        },
      },
    })
    ```

    ### Configuration [#configuration-web]

    To use the OAuth 2.0 flow, you will require the following information:

    1. Obtain OAuth credentials for your Google Cloud project in the [Credentials](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials) page of the console. When creating a new credential, choose _Web application_. In _Authorized redirect URIs_ enter `https://<project-id>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`. This URL will be seen by your users, and you can customize it by configuring [custom domains](/docs/guides/platform/custom-domains).
    2. Configure the [OAuth Consent Screen](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent). This information is shown to the user when giving consent to your app. Within _Authorized domains_ make sure you add your Supabase project's domain `<project-id>.supabase.co`. Configure the non-sensitive scopes by making sure the following ones are selected: `.../auth/userinfo.email`, `.../auth/userinfo.profile`, `openid`. If you're selecting other sensitive scopes, your app may require additional verification. In those cases, it's best to use [custom domains](/docs/guides/platform/custom-domains).
    3. Finally, add the client ID and secret from step 1 in the [Google provider on the Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers).

    ## Using personalized sign-in buttons, One Tap or automatic sign-in

    Most web apps and websites can utilize Google's [personalized sign-in buttons](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/personalized-button), [One Tap](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/features) or [automatic sign-in](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/automatic-sign-in-sign-out) for the best user experience.

    Under the hood, these sign in methods end with an identity token being issued by [Sign in with Google for Web](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/overview). You can then use the `supabase.auth.signInWithIdToken()` method to immediately issue an access and refresh tokens for the user, without needing to build any additional UIs or flows.

    To get started, you can use the [HTML Code Generator](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/tools/configurator) to customize the look, feel, features and behavior of the Sign in with Google button. Make sure you pick the _Swap to JavaScript callback_ option and name the function that will receive a [`CredentialResponse`](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/reference/js-reference#CredentialResponse) when sign in completes.

    For example, this HTML code shows a typical Sign in with Google button:

    ```html
    <div
      id="g_id_onload"
      data-client_id="<client ID>"
      data-context="signin"
      data-ux_mode="popup"
      data-callback="handleSignInWithGoogle"
      data-nonce=""
      data-auto_select="true"
      data-itp_support="true"
    ></div>

    <div
      class="g_id_signin"
      data-type="standard"
      data-shape="pill"
      data-theme="outline"
      data-text="signin_with"
      data-size="large"
      data-logo_alignment="left"
    ></div>
    ```

    When the user signs in, the `handleSignInWithGoogle` function will be called:

    ```ts
    async function handleSignInWithGoogle(response) {
      const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithIdToken({
        token: response.credential,
        nonce: 'NONCE', // must be the same one as provided in data-nonce (if any)
      })
    }
    ```

    Use of nonce is recommended, though optional. Make sure each nonce is generated randomly and available both in the `data-nonce` attribute as well as in the `handleSignInWithGoogle` callback function; otherwise the ID token will not be accepted.

    ### Important Note on Nonce Validation

    Supabase Auth expects the nonce in Google's ID token to be hashed (specifically with SHA-256 and represented as a hexadecimal string).

    To succeed with nonce validation, you will need to provide a hashed version of the nonce to Google and the non-hashed version to the `signInWithIdToken` method.

    The following code snippet provides an example of how to create both versions in a web application:

    ```js
    // Adapted from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SubtleCrypto/digest#converting_a_digest_to_a_hex_string

    import crypto from 'crypto'

    // ...

    const nonce = crypto.randomBytes(16).toString('base64') // Generate a random nonce
    const encoder = new TextEncoder()
    const encodedNonce = encoder.encode(nonce) // Encode the nonce
    const hash = await crypto.subtle.digest('SHA-256', encodedNonce) // Hash it with SHA-256
    const bytes = new Uint8Array(hash)
    const hashedNonce = Array.from(bytes)
      .map((b) => b.toString(16).padStart(2, '0')) // Convert the hash to a hexadecimal string
      .join('')

    // Use 'hashedNonce' when making the authentication request to Google
    // Use 'nonce' when invoking the supabase.auth.signInWithIdToken() method
    ```

    ### Configuration [#configuration-personalized-sign-in-button]

    1. Obtain OAuth credentials for your Google Cloud project in the [Credentials](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials) page of the console. When creating a new credential, choose _Web application_. As you're using the Google sign in button, you should configure the _Authorized JavaScript origins_ and _Authorized redirect URIs_ to the website where the buttons appear. You should not use your Supabase project domain name. For this use case, the client secret provided is not needed and can be ignored.
    2. Configure the [OAuth Consent Screen](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent). This information is shown to the user when giving consent to your app. In particular, make sure you have set up links to your app's privacy policy and terms of service.
    3. Finally, add the client ID from step 1 in the [Google provider on the Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers) under _Authorized Client IDs_.

    Note that you do not have to configure the OAuth flow client ID and secret in the Supabase Dashboard when using this approach!

    ## Using Native Sign in with Google in Expo

    Unlike the OAuth flow which requires the use of a web browser, the native Sign in with Google flow on Android uses the [operating system's built-in functionalities](https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/auth/api/identity/package-summary) to prompt the user for consent. Note that native sign-in has been rebranded as _One Tap sign-in on Android_ by Google, which you should not confuse with _One Tap sign in for web_, as mentioned below.

    When the user provides consent, Google issues an identity token (commonly abbreviated as ID token) that is then sent to your project's Supabase Auth server. When valid, a new user session is started by issuing an access and refresh token from Supabase Auth.

    When working with Expo, you can use the [`react-native-google-signin/google-signin` library](https://github.com/react-native-google-signin/google-signin#expo-installation) library to obtain an ID token that you can pass to supabase-js [`signInWithIdToken` method](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signinwithidtoken).

    Follow the [Expo installation docs](https://github.com/react-native-google-signin/google-signin#expo-installation) for installation and configuration instructions. See the [supabase-js reference](/docs/reference/javascript/initializing?example=react-native-options-async-storage) for instructions on initializing the supabase-js client in React Native.

    ```tsx ./components/Auth.native.tsx
    import {
      GoogleSignin,
      GoogleSigninButton,
      statusCodes,
    } from '@react-native-google-signin/google-signin'
    import { supabase } from '../utils/supabase'

    export default function () {
      GoogleSignin.configure({
        scopes: ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly'],
        webClientId: 'YOUR CLIENT ID FROM GOOGLE CONSOLE',
      })

      return (
        <GoogleSigninButton
          size={GoogleSigninButton.Size.Wide}
          color={GoogleSigninButton.Color.Dark}
          onPress={async () => {
            try {
              await GoogleSignin.hasPlayServices()
              const userInfo = await GoogleSignin.signIn()
              if (userInfo.idToken) {
                const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithIdToken({
                  provider: 'google',
                  token: userInfo.idToken,
                })
                console.log(error, data)
              } else {
                throw new Error('no ID token present!')
              }
            } catch (error: any) {
              if (error.code === statusCodes.SIGN_IN_CANCELLED) {
                // user cancelled the login flow
              } else if (error.code === statusCodes.IN_PROGRESS) {
                // operation (e.g. sign in) is in progress already
              } else if (error.code === statusCodes.PLAY_SERVICES_NOT_AVAILABLE) {
                // play services not available or outdated
              } else {
                // some other error happened
              }
            }
          }}
        />
      )
    }
    ```

    ### Configuration [#expo-configuration-native-app]

    1. Configure OAuth credentials for your Google Cloud project in the [Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) page of the console. When creating a new OAuth client ID, choose _Android_ or _iOS_ depending on the mobile operating system your app is built for.

    - For Android, use the instructions on screen to provide the SHA-1 certificate fingerprint used to sign your Android app.
    - For iOS, use the instructions on screen to provide the app Bundle ID, and App Store ID and Team ID if the app is already published on the Apple AppStore.

    2. Configure the [OAuth Consent Screen](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent). This information is shown to the user when giving consent to your app. In particular, make sure you have set up links to your app's privacy policy and terms of service.
    3. Finally, add the client ID from step 1 in the [Google provider on the Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers), under _Authorized Client IDs_.

    Note that you do not have to configure the OAuth flow in the Supabase Dashboard in order to use native sign in.

    ## Using Native Sign in with Google in Flutter

    Native Google sign in with Supabase is done through the [google_sign_in](https://pub.dev/packages/google_sign_in) package for iOS and Android. Follow the instructions on the [google_sign_in](https://pub.dev/packages/google_sign_in) package for plugin specific settings.

    When the user provides consent, Google issues an identity token (commonly abbreviated as ID token) that is then sent to your project's Supabase Auth server. When valid, a new user session is started by issuing an access and refresh token from Supabase Auth.

    Follow the code sample below to implement native Google sign in with Supabase in your Flutter app.

    ```dart
    import 'package:google_sign_in/google_sign_in.dart';
    import 'package:supabase_flutter/supabase_flutter.dart';

    ...

    Future<AuthResponse> _googleSignIn() async {
      /// TODO: update the Web client ID with your own.
      ///
      /// Web Client ID that you registered with Google Cloud.
      const webClientId = 'my-web.apps.googleusercontent.com';

      /// TODO: update the iOS client ID with your own.
      ///
      /// iOS Client ID that you registered with Google Cloud.
      const iosClientId = 'my-ios.apps.googleusercontent.com';

      // Google sign in on Android will work without providing the Android
      // Client ID registered on Google Cloud.

      final GoogleSignIn googleSignIn = GoogleSignIn(
        clientId: iosClientId,
        serverClientId: webClientId,
      );
      final googleUser = await googleSignIn.signIn();
      final googleAuth = await googleUser!.authentication;
      final accessToken = googleAuth.accessToken;
      final idToken = googleAuth.idToken;

      if (accessToken == null) {
        throw 'No Access Token found.';
      }
      if (idToken == null) {
        throw 'No ID Token found.';
      }

      return supabase.auth.signInWithIdToken(
        provider: Provider.google,
        idToken: idToken,
        accessToken: accessToken,
      );
    }
    ...
    ```

    ### Configuration [#flutter-configuration-native-app]

    1. Configure OAuth credentials for your Google Cloud project in the [Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) page of the console. When creating a new OAuth client ID, choose _Android_ or _iOS_ depending on the mobile operating system your app is built for. Also create a web client ID.

    - For Android, use the instructions on screen to provide the SHA-1 certificate fingerprint used to sign your Android app. You also need to create a web client ID to perform Google sign in on Android.
    - For iOS, use the instructions on screen to provide the app Bundle ID, and App Store ID and Team ID if the app is already published on the Apple AppStore.

    2. Configure the [OAuth Consent Screen](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent). This information is shown to the user when giving consent to your app. In particular, make sure you have set up links to your app's privacy policy and terms of service.
    3. Finally, add the web client ID from step 1 in the [Google provider on the Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers), under _Authorized Client IDs_. You do not need to add the Android or iOS client ID here. If you need iOS support, enable the `Skip nonce check` option.

    Note that you do not have to configure the OAuth flow in the Supabase Dashboard in order to use native sign in.

    When using [Compose Multiplatform](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform/), you can use the [compose-auth](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/kotlin/installing) plugin. On Android it uses Google OneTap automatically and on other platforms it uses `gotrue.loginWith(Google)`.
    Alternatively, you can have a look at [Google One Tap](https://developers.google.com/identity/one-tap/android/overview), just login with the IdToken after you receive it.

    **Initialize the Supabase Client**

    **Note:** You have to create OAuth credentials for both a Web and Android application. [Learn more](https://developers.google.com/identity/one-tap/android/get-started#api-console)

    ```kotlin
    val supabaseClient = createSupabaseClient(
        supabaseUrl = "SUPABASE_URL",
        supabaseKey = "SUPABASE_KEY"
    ) {
        install(GoTrue)
        install(ComposeAuth) {
            nativeGoogleLogin("WEB_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID") //Use the Web Client ID, not the Android one!
        }
    }
    ```

    **Use the Compose Auth plugin in your Auth Screen**

    ```kotlin
    val authState = supabaseClient.composeAuth.rememberLoginWithGoogle(
        onResult = {
            when(it) { //handle errors
                NativeSignInResult.ClosedByUser -> TODO()
                is NativeSignInResult.Error -> TODO()
                is NativeSignInResult.NetworkError -> TODO()
                NativeSignInResult.Success -> TODO()
            }
        }
    )

    Button(onClick = { authState.startFlow() }) {
        Text("Sign in with Google")
    }
    ```

  <TabPanel id="chrome-extensions" label="Chrome Extensions">

    ## Using native sign in for Chrome extensions

    Similar to the native sign in for Android, you can use the Chrome browser's [identity APIs](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/identity/) to launch an authentication flow.

    First, you need to configure your `manifest.json` file like so:

    ```json
    {
      "permissions": ["identity"],
      "oauth2": {
        "client_id": "<client ID>",
        "scopes": ["openid", "email", "profile"]
      }
    }
    ```

    Then you should call the [`chrome.identity.launchWebAuthFlow()`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/identity/#method-launchWebAuthFlow) function to trigger the sign in flow. On success, call the `supabase.auth.signInWithIdToken()` function to complete sign in with your Supabase project.

    ```ts
    const manifest = chrome.runtime.getManifest()

    const url = new URL('https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth')

    url.searchParams.set('client_id', manifest.oauth2.client_id)
    url.searchParams.set('response_type', 'id_token')
    url.searchParams.set('access_type', 'offline')
    url.searchParams.set('redirect_uri', `https://${chrome.runtime.id}.chromiumapp.org`)
    url.searchParams.set('scope', manifest.oauth2.scopes.join(' '))

    chrome.identity.launchWebAuthFlow(
      {
        url: url.href,
        interactive: true,
      },
      async (redirectedTo) => {
        if (chrome.runtime.lastError) {
          // auth was not successful
        } else {
          // auth was successful, extract the ID token from the redirectedTo URL
          const url = new URL(redirectedTo)
          const params = new URLSearchParams(url.hash)

          const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithIdToken({
            provider: 'google',
            token: params.get('id_token'),
          })
        }
      }
    )
    ```

    ### Configuration [#configuration-chrome-extension]

    You will need to configure a client ID for your Chrome extension:

    1. Configure OAuth credentials for your Google Cloud project in the [Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) page of the console. When creating a new OAuth client ID, choose _Chrome extension_ for the application type. For _Item ID_ provide the unique ID of your Chrome extension. You can get this by calling `chrome.runtime.id` within the extension, or from the Web Store URL of the extension. For example, the [Google Translate extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-translate/aapbdbdomjkkjkaonfhkkikfgjllcleb) has the Web Store URL `https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-translate/aapbdbdomjkkjkaonfhkkikfgjllcleb` and the last part `aapbdbdomjkkjkaonfhkkikfgjllcleb` is its unique ID.
    2. Configure the [OAuth Consent Screen](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent). This information is shown to the user when giving consent to your app.
    3. Finally, add the client ID from step 1 in the [Google provider on the Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers), under _Authorized Client IDs_.

    Note that you do not have to configure the OAuth flow in the Supabase Dashboard to sign in with Google inside Chrome extensions.
