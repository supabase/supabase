To enable WorkOS Auth for your project, you need to set up WorkOS OAuth application and add the application credentials to your Supabase Dashboard.

## Overview

In this guide, we will cover how to use Supabase OAuth with WorkOS to implement Single-Sign-On(SSO).

The procedure consists of five broad steps:

- Create a new organization from your WorkOS Dashboard.
- Obtain the `Client ID` from the Configuration tab and configure redirect URI.
- Obtain the `WorkOS Secret` from the credentials tab.
- Connect a WorkOS Supported Identity Provider
- Add your WorkOS credentials into your Supabase project

## Create a WorkOS Organization

Log in to the dashboard and hop over to the Organizations tab to create and organization

## Obtain the Client ID and configure Redirect URI

Head over to the Configuration tab and configure the redirect URI.The redirect URI should look like `https://<project-ref>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
Note that this is distinct from the redirect URI referred to in the Supabase dashboard

## Obtain the WorkOS Secret

Head over to the API Keys page and obtain the secret key.

## Connect a WorkOS Supported Identity Provider

Set up the identity provider by visiting the setup link.

You can pick between any one of the many identity providers that WorkOS supports.

## Add your WorkOS credentials into your Supabase Project

<SocialProviderSettingsSupabase provider="WorkOS" />

## Add login code to your client app

When your user signs in, call [signInWithOAuth()](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signinwithoauth) with `workos` as the `provider`:

```js
async function signInWithWorkOS() {
  const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({
    provider: 'workos',
    options: {
      queryParams: {
        connection: '<your_connection>',
        organization: '<your_organization',
        provider: '<your_provider>',
      },
    },
  })
}
```

Refer to the [WorkOS Documentation](https://workos.com/docs/reference/sso/authorize/) to learn more about the different methods.

When your user signs out, call [signOut()](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signout) to remove them from the browser session and any objects from localStorage:

```js
async function signout() {
  const { error } = await supabase.auth.signOut()
}
```
