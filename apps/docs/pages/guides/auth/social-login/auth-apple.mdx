}

To enable Apple Auth for your project, you need to set up an Apple OAuth application and add the application credentials to your Supabase Dashboard.

## Overview

Apple OAuth consists of six broad steps:

- Obtaining an `App Id` with “Sign In with Apple” capabilities.
- Obtaining a `Services Id` - this will serve as the `client_id`.
- Obtaining a `secret key` that will be used to get our `client_secret`.
- Generating the `client_secret` using the `secret key`.
- Add your `client id` and `client secret` keys to your [Supabase Project](https://app.supabase.com).
- Add the login code to your [Supabase JS Client App](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js).

## Access your Apple Developer account

- Go to [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com).
- Click on `Account` at the top right to log in.

## Obtain an App ID

- Go to `Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles`.
- Click on `Identifiers` at the left.
- Click on the `+` sign in the upper left next to `Identifiers`.
- Select `App IDs` and click `Continue`.
- Select type `App` and click `Continue`.
- Fill out your app information:
  - App description.
  - Bundle ID (Apple recommends reverse-domain name style, so if your domain is acme.com and your app is called roadrunner, use: "com.acme.roadrunner").
  - Scroll down and check `Sign In With Apple`.
  - Click `Continue` at the top right.
  - Click `Register` at the top right.

## Obtain a Services ID

This will serve as the `client_id` when you make API calls to authenticate the user.

- Go to `Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles`.
- Click on `Identifiers` at the left.
- Click on the `+` sign in the upper left next to `Identifiers`.
- Select `Services IDs` and click `Continue`.
- Fill out your information:
  - App description.
  - Bundle ID (you can't use the same Bundle ID from the previous step, but you can just add something to the beginning, such as "app." to make it app.com.acme.roadrunner").
  - SAVE THIS ID -- this ID will become your `client_id` later.
  - Click `Continue` at the top right.
  - Click `Register` at the top right.

## Find your callback URL

<SocialProviderSetup provider="Apple" />

## Configure your Services ID

- Under `Identifiers`, click on your newly-created Services ID.
- Check the box next to `Sign In With Apple` to enable it.
- Click `Configure` to the right.
- Make sure your newly created Bundle ID is selected under `Primary App ID`
- Add your domain to the `Domains and Subdomains` box (do not add `https://`, just add the domain).
- In the `Return URLs` box, type the callback URL of your app which you found in the previous step and click `Next` at the bottom right.
- Click `Done` at the bottom.
- Click `Continue` at the top right.
- Click `Save` at the top right.

## Download your secret key

Now you'll need to download a `secret key` file from Apple that will be used to generate your `client_secret`.

- Go to `Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles`.
- Click on `Keys` at the left.
- Click on the `+` sign in the upper left next to `Keys`.
- Enter a `Key Name`.
- Check `Sign In with Apple`.
- Click `Configure` to the right.
- Select your newly-created Services ID from the dropdown selector.
- Click `Save` at the top right.
- Click `Continue` at the top right.
- Click `Register` at the top right.
- Click `Download` at the top right.
- Save the downloaded file -- this contains your "secret key" that will be used to generate your `client_secret`.
- Click `Done` at the top right.

## Generate a client secret

You need to configure a client secret when using Sign in with Apple for Web. This is a specially crafted [JWT signed with a secret key downloaded from Apple's Developer Center](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/signinwithapplerestapi/generate_and_validate_tokens).

## Add your OAuth credentials to Supabase

<SocialProviderSettingsSupabase provider="Apple" />

## Add login code to your client app

When your user signs in, call [signInWithOAuth()](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signinwithoauth) with `apple` as the `provider`:

```js
async function signInWithApple() {
  const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({
    provider: 'apple',
  })
}
```

When your user signs out, call [signOut()](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signout) to remove them from the browser session and any objects from localStorage:

```js
async function signout() {
  const { error } = await supabase.auth.signOut()
}
```
