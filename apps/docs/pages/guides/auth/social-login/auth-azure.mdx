To enable Azure (Microsoft) Auth for your project, you need to set up an Azure OAuth application and add the application credentials to your Supabase Dashboard.

## Overview

Azure OAuth consists of four broad steps:

- Create an application under Azure Active Directory.
- Obtain a `Application (client) ID` with “Sign In with Azure” capabilities. This will be used as the `client id`.
- Create a `Secret ID` with “Sign In with Azure” capabilities. The value of the secret will be used as the `client secret`.
- Add the callback url of your application to the allowlist.

## Access your Azure Developer account

- Go to [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com/#home).
- Login and select "Azure Active Directory" under the list of Azure Services.

## Register an application

- Under Azure Active Directory, select "App registrations" in the side panel.
- Select "New registration".
- Choose a name and select your preferred option for the supported account types.
- Specify the "Redirect URI".
- The redirect / callback URI should look like this: `https://<project-ref>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
- Click "Register" at the bottom of the form.

## Obtain a Client ID

This will serve as the `client_id` when you make API calls to authenticate the user.

- Once your app has been registered, the client id can be found under the [list of app registrations](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/RegisteredApps) under the column titled "Application (client) ID".

## Obtain a Secret ID

This will serve as the `client_secret` when you make API calls to authenticate the user.

- Click on the name of the app registered above.
- Under "Essentials", click on "Client credentials".
- Navigate to the "Client secrets" tab and select "New client secret".
- Enter a description and choose your preferred expiry for the secret.
- Once the secret is generated, save the `value` (not the secret ID).

## Obtain the Tenant URL (Optional)

The default tenant url is `https://login.microsoftonline.com/common`. This will allow users with personal Azure accounts as well as with Azure work accounts, other than that of your own organization, to sign in to your app. This is set by default in Supabase and you can leave the `Azure Tenant URL` field blank in your provider settings.

If you want to allow users from **your Azure organization only** to be able to log in to you app

- Select the Directory (Tenant) ID value
- Set the tenant URL in your Supabase Azure Provider settings to `https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant-id>`

## Add login code to your client app

<Admonition type="tip">

Supabase Auth requires that Azure returns a valid email address. Therefore you must request the `email` scope in the `signIn` method above.

</Admonition>

When your user signs in, call [signInWithOAuth()](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signinwithoauth) with `azure` as the `provider`:

```js
async function signInWithAzure() {
  const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({
    provider: 'azure',
    options: {
      scopes: 'email',
    },
  })
}
```

When your user signs out, call [signOut()](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signout) to remove them from the browser session and any objects from localStorage:

```js
async function signout() {
  const { error } = await supabase.auth.signOut()
}
```

## Obtain the provider refresh token

Azure OAuth2.0 doesn't return the `provider_refresh_token` by default. If you need the `provider_refresh_token` returned, you will need to include the following scope:

```js
async function signInWithAzure() {
  const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({
    provider: 'azure',
    options: {
      scopes: 'offline_access',
    },
  })
}
```
