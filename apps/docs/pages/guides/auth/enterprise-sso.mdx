Supabase Auth supports building enterprise applications that require Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication. At this time only [SSO with SAML 2.0](/guides/auth/sso/auth-sso-saml) is supported in an early beta.

If you are interested in using SAML 2.0 SSO with your Supabase project, please [open a new support ticket](https://app.supabase.com/support/new).
