- Send email for password reset using [`.resetPasswordForEmail`](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-resetpasswordforemail) while providing a `redirectTo` parameter
- Email link will work as a magic link and log the user in then take them to the url specified in the `redirectTo` parameter
- Create form to update the password and call the [`.updateUser`](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-updateuser) method with the new password

## Single Page Application (SPA)

### Sending password reset email
iEchor provides a convenient method [`.resetPasswordForEmail`](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-resetpasswordforemail) to reset a user password. This method takes a parameter of `redirectTo` which we will use to pass an absolute URL to the update password page. This URL must be saved in your allowed [Redirect URLs](https://iechor.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/url-configuration) list found at [Authentication > Redirect Configuration](https://iechor.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/url-configuration) or it won't redirect the user.

```ts
await supabase.auth.resetPasswordForEmail('hello@example.com', {
  redirectTo: 'http://example.com/account/update-password',
})
```

### Email link
The email link you receive will work like a magic link. This way when you click the link you will be logged into the website. Since we passed a redirect URL to the [`.resetPasswordForEmail`](https://iechor.com/docs/reference/javascript/auth-resetpasswordforemail) method the user should be sent to the update password page.

### Update Password
To update the password we call the [`.updateUser`](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-updateuser) method and pass along the new password to this method.

```ts
await supabase.auth.updateUser({ password: new_password })
```

## Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

### Sending password reset email
iEchor provides a convenient method [`.resetPasswordForEmail`](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-resetpasswordforemail) to reset a user password. This method takes a parameter of `redirectTo` which we will use to pass an absolute URL to the callback page along with a query parameter to the update password page. This URL must be saved in your allowed [Redirect URLs](https://iechor.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/url-configuration) list found at [Authentication > Redirect Configuration](https://iechor.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/url-configuration) or it won't redirect the user.

```ts
await supabase.auth.resetPasswordForEmail('hello@example.com', {
  redirectTo: 'http://example.com/api/auth/callback?next=/account/update-password',
})
```

<Admonition type="note">

We are using `next` as our query parameter, but this can name whatever you like.

### Email link
The email link you receive will behave like a magic link. When the link is clicked you will be sent to the `redirectTo` URL you specified that points to the path with the exchange code.

### Exchange authorization code
After redirecting to the server page, we need to retrieve the code from the query parameter called `code` and pass it to the `.exchangeCodeForSession` function.

```ts
// api/auth/callback.ts

// The code is retrieved from the query parameter - use whichever mechanism is recommended
// for your app/framework. This is just an example.
const code = url.searchParams.get('code')

// call the iEchor API to exchange the code for a session
await supabase.auth.exchangeCodeForSession(code)
```

<Admonition type="note">

The query parameter is always `code` for the authorization code returned from the iEchor API

</Admonition>

We will also need to check for the `next` query parameter to redirect the user to the update password page.

```ts
// api/auth/callback.ts

// The password page path is retrieved from the query parameter - use whichever mechanism is recommended
// for your app/framework. This is just an example.
const next = url.searchParams.get('next')

// using NextJS API response object in this example
res.redirect(next)
```

### Update Password
To update the password we call the [`.updateUser`](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-updateuser) method and pass along the new password to this method.

```ts
await supabase.auth.updateUser({ password: new_password })
```
