## The user object

The user object stores all the information related to a user in your application. The user object can be retrieved using one of these methods:

1. [`supabase.auth.getUser()`](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-getuser)
2. Retrieve a user object as an admin using [`supabase.auth.admin.getUserById()`](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-admin-listusers)

A user can sign in with one of the following methods:

- Password-based method (with email or phone)
- Passwordless method (with email or phone)
- OAuth
- SAML SSO

An identity describes the authentication method that a user can use to sign in. A user can have multiple identities. These are the types of identities supported:

- Email
- Phone
- OAuth
- SAML

<Admonition type="note">

A user with an email or phone identity will be able to sign in with either a password or passwordless method (e.g. use a one-time password (OTP) or magiclink). By default, a user with an unverified email or phone number will not be able to sign in.

The user object contains the following attributes:

## Configuration

Supabase Auth provides these [configuration options](/dashboard/project/_/settings/auth) to control user access to your application:

- **Allow new users to sign up**: Users will be able to sign up. If this config is disabled, only existing users can sign in.
- **Allow unverified email sign in**: Users will not need to have a verified email address to sign in.

  - If enabled, you can structure your RLS policies to provide different access controls to a user with an unverified email and a user with a verified email. For example,

  ```sql
  -- Allows a user to read all posts regardless of whether they have a verified email address
  create policy "policy_name"
  ON public.posts
  for select to authenticated using (
      true
  );

  -- Only allow users with a verified email address to insert posts
  create policy "policy_name"
  ON public.posts
  for insert to authenticated with check (
      auth.jwt()->>'email_verified' is true
  );
  ```

- **Confirm Email (Deprecated)**: Users will need to confirm their email address before signing in for the first time.
  - Having **Confirm Email** disabled assumes that the user's email does not need to be verified in order to login and implicitly confirms the user's email in the database.
  - If you previously relied on this config to autoconfirm a user's email address, you can switch to use **Allow unverified email sign in** instead. This new option allows the user to sign in with an unverified email which you can keep track of through the user object. It provides more versatility if you require your users to verify their email address in the future since you can structure your RLS policies to check the user's `email_verified` field.
