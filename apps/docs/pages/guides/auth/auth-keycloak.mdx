To enable Keycloak Auth for your project, you need to set up an Keycloak OAuth application and add the application credentials to your Supabase Dashboard.

## Overview

To get started with Keycloak, you can run it in a docker container with: `docker run -e KEYCLOAK_USER=admin -e KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD=admin -p 8080:8080 jboss/keycloak:latest`

This guide will be assuming that you are running keycloak in a docker container as described in the command above.

Keycloak OAuth consists of five broad steps:

- Create a new client in your specified keycloak realm.
- Obtain the `issuer` from the "OpenID Endpoint Configuration". This will be used as the `Keycloak URL`.
- Ensure that the new client has the "Client Protocol" set to "openid-connect" and the "Access Type" is set to "confidential".
- The `Client ID` of the client created will be used as the `client id`.
- Obtain the `Secret` from the credentials tab which will be used as the `client secret`.
- Add the callback url of your application to your allowlist.

## Access your Keycloak Admin console

- Login by visiting [`http://localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080) and clicking on "Administration Console".

## Create a Keycloak Realm

- Once you've logged in to the Keycloak console, you can add a realm from the side panel. The default realm should be named "Master".
- After you've added a new realm, you can retrieve the `issuer` from the "OpenID Endpoint Configuration" endpoint. The `issuer` will be used as the `Keycloak URL`.
- You can find this endpoint from the realm settings under the "General Tab" or visit [`http://localhost:8080/realms/my_realm_name/.well-known/openid-configuration`](http://localhost:8080/realms/my_realm_name/.well-known/openid-configuration)

## Create a Keycloak Client

The "Client ID" of the created client will serve as the `client_id` when you make API calls to authenticate the user.

## Client Settings

After you've created the client successfully, ensure that you set the following settings:

1. The "Client Protocol" should be set to "openid-connect".
2. The "Access Type" should be set to "confidential".
3. The "Valid Redirect URIs" should be set to: `https://<project-ref>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`.

## Obtain the Client Secret

This will serve as the `client_secret` when you make API calls to authenticate the user.
Under the "Credentials" tab, the `Secret` value will be used as the `client secret`.

## Add login code to your client app

When your user signs in, call [signInWithOAuth()](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signinwithoauth) with `keycloak` as the `provider`:

```js
async function signInWithKeycloak() {
  const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({
    provider: 'keycloak',
    options: {
      scopes: 'openid',
    },
  })
}
```

When your user signs out, call [signOut()](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signout) to remove them from the browser session and any objects from localStorage:

```js
async function signout() {
  const { error } = await supabase.auth.signOut()
}
```
