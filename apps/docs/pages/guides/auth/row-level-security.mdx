When you need granular authorization rules, nothing beats PostgreSQL's [Row Level Security (RLS)](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-rowsecurity.html).

[Policies](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createpolicy.html) are PostgreSQL's rule engine. They are incredibly powerful and flexible, allowing you to write complex SQL rules which fit your unique business needs.

## Policies

Policies are easy to understand once you get the hang of them. Each policy is attached to a table, and the policy is executed every time a table is accessed.
You can just think of them as adding a `WHERE` clause to every query. For example a policy like this ...

```sql
create policy "Individuals can view their own todos."
    on todos for select
    using ( auth.uid() = user_id );
```

.. would translate to this whenever a user tries to select from the todos table:

```sql
select *
from todos
where auth.uid() = todos.user_id; -- Policy is implicitly added.
```

## Helper Functions

Supabase provides you with a few easy functions that you can use with your policies.

### `auth.uid()`

Returns the ID of the user making the request.

### `auth.jwt()`

Returns the JWT of the user making the request.

## Examples

Here are some examples to show you the power of PostgreSQL's RLS.

### Allow read access

```sql
-- 1. Create table
create table profiles (
  id uuid references auth.users,
  avatar_url text
);

-- 2. Enable RLS
alter table profiles
  enable row level security;

-- 3. Create Policy
create policy "Public profiles are viewable by everyone."
  on profiles for select using (
    true
  );
```

1. Creates a table called `profiles` in the public schema (default schema).
2. Enables Row Level Security.
3. Creates a policy which allows all `select` queries to run.

### Restrict updates

```sql
-- 1. Create table
create table profiles (
  id uuid references auth.users,
  avatar_url text
);

-- 2. Enable RLS
alter table profiles
  enable row level security;

-- 3. Create Policy
create policy "Users can update their own profiles."
  on profiles for update using (
    auth.uid() = id
  );
```

1. Creates a table called `profiles` in the public schema (default schema).
2. Enables RLS.
3. Creates a policy which allows logged in users to update their own data.

**Note:** If you want to use upsert operations, the user needs to have `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `SELECT` permissions.

### Only anon or authenticated access

You can add a Postgres role

```sql
create policy "Public profiles are viewable by everyone."
on profiles for select
to authenticated, anon
using (
  true
);
```

### Policies with joins

Policies can even include table joins. This example shows how you can query "external" tables to build more advanced rules.

```sql
create table teams (
  id serial primary key,
  name text
);

-- 2. Create many to many join
create table members (
  team_id bigint references teams,
  user_id uuid references auth.users
);

-- 3. Enable RLS
alter table teams
  enable row level security;

-- 4. Create Policy
create policy "Team members can update team details if they belong to the team."
  on teams
  for update using (
    auth.uid() in (
      select user_id from members
      where team_id = id
    )
  );
```

**Note:** If RLS is also enabled for _members_, the user must also have read (_select_) access to _members_. Otherwise the joined query will not yield any results.

### Policies with security definer functions

Policies can also make use of `security definer functions`. This is useful in a many-to-many relationship where you want to restrict access to the linking table. Following the `teams` and `members` example from above, this example shows how you can use the security definer function in combination with a policy to control access to the `members` table.

```sql
-- 1. Follow example for 'Policies with joins' above

-- 2.  Enable RLS
alter table members
  enable row level security

-- 3.  Create security definer function
create or replace function get_teams_for_authenticated_user()
returns setof bigint
language sql
security definer
set search_path = public
stable
as $$
    select team_id
    from members
    where user_id = auth.uid()
$$;

-- 4. Create Policy
create policy "Team members can update team members if they belong to the team."
  on members
  for all using (
    team_id in (
      select get_teams_for_authenticated_user()
    )
  );

```

### Verifying email domains

Postgres has a function `right(string, n)` that returns the rightmost n characters of a string.
You could use this to match staff member's email domains.

```sql
-- 1. Create table
create table leaderboard (
  id uuid references auth.users,
  high_score bigint
);

-- 2. Enable RLS
alter table leaderboard
  enable row level security;

-- 3. Create Policy
create policy "Only Blizzard staff can update leaderboard"
  on leaderboard
  for update using (
    right(auth.jwt() ->> 'email', 13) = '@blizzard.com'
  );
```

### Time to live for rows

Policies can also be used to implement TTL or time to live feature that you see in Instagram stories or Snapchat.
In the following example, rows of `stories` table are available only if they have been created within the last 24 hours.

```sql
-- 1. Create table
create table if not exists stories (
  id uuid not null primary key DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc' :: text, now()) not null,
  content text not null
);

-- 2. Enable RLS
alter table stories
  enable row level security;

-- 3. Create Policy
create policy "Stories are live for a day"
  on stories
  for select using (
    created_at > (current_timestamp - interval '1 day')
  );
```

### Advanced policies

Use the full power of SQL to build extremely advanced rules.

In this example, we will create a `posts` and `comments` tables and then create a policy that depends on another policy.
(In this case, the comments policy depends on the posts policy.)

```sql
create table posts (
  id            serial    primary key,
  creator_id    uuid      not null     references auth.users(id),
  title         text      not null,
  body          text      not null,
  publish_date  date      not null     default now(),
  audience      uuid[]    null -- many to many table omitted for brevity
);

create table comments (
  id            serial    primary key,
  post_id       int       not null     references posts(id)  on delete cascade,
  user_id       uuid      not null     references auth.users(id),
  body          text      not null,
  comment_date  date      not null     default now()
);

create policy "Creator can see their own posts"
on posts
for select
using (
  auth.uid() = posts.creator_id
);

create policy "Logged in users can see the posts if they belong to the post 'audience'."
on posts
for select
using (
  auth.uid() = any (posts.audience)
);

create policy "Users can see all comments for posts they have access to."
on comments
for select
using (
  exists (
    select 1 from posts
    where posts.id = comments.post_id
  )
);
```

## Tips

### You don't have to use policies

You can also put your authorization rules in your middleware, similar to how you would create security rules with any other `backend <-> middleware <-> frontend` architecture. You can use Edge Functions to run this architecture, or you can use your favorite server framework, like Rails, Django, Node.js, Phoenix, or Laravel.

Policies are a tool. In the case of "serverless/Jamstack" setups, they are especially effective because you don't have to deploy any middleware at all and can use the javascript libraries directly from the browser.

That said, if you want to use another authorization method for your applications that's also fine. Supabase is "just Postgres", so if your application works with Postgres, then it also works with Supabase.

If you plan to use this approach make sure to enable RLS for your tables. Then use the `service_role` key (for our client libraries) or the `postgres` role - both of these can bypass RLS. You don't need to create any policies with this approach, simply enabling RLS is sufficient:

```sql
create table profiles (
  id serial primary key,
  email text
);

alter table profiles enable row level security;
```

### Never use a service key on the client

Supabase provides special "Service" keys, which can be used to bypass all RLS.
These should never be used in the browser or exposed to customers, but they are useful for administrative tasks.
<Admonition type="caution">
Initializing a client with a Service Key will not override RLS if a user token is set. If a user is signed in with a client, Supabase will adhere to the RLS policy of the user.
</Admonition>

### Testing policies

To test policies on the database itself (i.e., from the [SQL Editor](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/sql) or from `psql`) without switching to your frontend and logging in as different users, you can utilize the following helper SQL procedures ([credits](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/issues/7311#issuecomment-1398648114)):

```sql
grant anon, authenticated to postgres;

create or replace procedure auth.login_as_user (user_email text)
    language plpgsql
    as $$
declare
    auth_user auth.users;
begin
    select
        * into auth_user
    from
        auth.users
    where
        email = user_email;
    execute format('set request.jwt.claim.sub=%L', (auth_user).id::text);
    execute format('set request.jwt.claim.role=%I', (auth_user).role);
    execute format('set request.jwt.claim.email=%L', (auth_user).email);
    execute format('set request.jwt.claims=%L', json_strip_nulls(json_build_object('app_metadata', (auth_user).raw_app_meta_data))::text);

    raise notice '%', format( 'set role %I; -- logging in as %L (%L)', (auth_user).role, (auth_user).id, (auth_user).email);
    execute format('set role %I', (auth_user).role);
end;
$$;

create or replace procedure auth.login_as_anon ()
    language plpgsql
    as $$
begin
    set request.jwt.claim.sub='';
    set request.jwt.claim.role='';
    set request.jwt.claim.email='';
    set request.jwt.claims='';
    set role anon;
end;
$$;

create or replace procedure auth.logout ()
    language plpgsql
    as $$
begin
    set request.jwt.claim.sub='';
    set request.jwt.claim.role='';
    set request.jwt.claim.email='';
    set request.jwt.claims='';
    set role postgres;
end;
$$;
```

To switch to a given user (by email), use `call auth.login_as_user('my@email.com');`. You can also switch to the `anon` role using `call auth.login_as_anon();`. When you are done, use `call auth.logout();` to return yourself to the `postgres` role.

These procedures can also be used for writing [pgTAP](/docs/guides/database/extensions/pgtap) unit tests for policies.

This example shows that the `public.profiles` table from the tutorial example can indeed be updated by the `postgres` role and the owner of the row but not from `anon` connections:

## Deprecated features

We have deprecate some functions to ensure better performance and extensibilty of RLS policies.

### `auth.role()`

<Admonition type="caution">

Deprecated: The `auth.role()` function has been deprecated in favour of using the `TO` field, natively supported within Postgres.

</Admonition>

```sql
-- DEPRECATED
create policy "Public profiles are viewable by everyone."
on profiles for select using (
  auth.role() = 'authenticated' or auth.role() = 'anon'
);

-- RECOMMENDED
create policy "Public profiles are viewable by everyone."
on profiles for select
to authenticated, anon
using (
  true
);
```

### `auth.email()`

<Admonition type="caution">

Deprecated. Use `auth.jwt() ->> 'email'` instead.

</Admonition>

Returns the email of the user making the request.
