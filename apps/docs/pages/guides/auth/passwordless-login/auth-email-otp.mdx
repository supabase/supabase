Email one-time passwords (OTP) are a form of passwordless login where users key in a six digit code sent to their email address to log in to their accounts. By default, a user can only request an OTP once every 60 seconds and they expire after 24 hours.

## Setting up email OTP

To set up email OTP for your Supabase app:

- Enable the email provider in your [Supabase Project](/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers)
- The Site URL represents the default URL that the user will be redirected to after clicking on the email signup confirmation link.
- If a user has not signed up yet, signing in with an OTP will automatically sign up the user. To prevent users from signing up this way, you can set the `shouldCreateUser` option to `false`.
- Navigate to the [email template settings](/dashboard/project/_/auth/templates) and modify the template to include the `{{ .Token }}` variable, for example:

```html
<h2>One time login code</h2>

<p>Please enter this code: {{ .Token }}</p>
```

## Signing in a user with email OTP

<Tabs
  scrollable
  size="small"
  type="underlined"
  defaultActiveId="js"
  queryGroup="language"
>
<TabPanel id="js" label="JavaScript">
When your user signs in, call [signInWithOtp()](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signinwithotp) with their email address:

```js
const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithOtp({
  email: 'example@email.com',
  options: {
    // set this to false if you do not want the user to be automatically signed up
    shouldCreateUser: false,
  },
})
```

</TabPanel>
<TabPanel id="dart" label="Dart">

When your user signs in, call [signInWithOtp()](/docs/reference/dart/auth-signinwithotp) with their email address:

```dart
Future<void> signInWithEmailOtp() async {
  final AuthResponse res = await supabase.auth.signInWithOtp(email: 'example@email.com');
}
```

</TabPanel>
<TabPanel id="kotlin" label="Kotlin">

When your user signs in, call [signInWith(OTP)](/docs/reference/kotlin/auth-signinwithotp) with their email address:

```kotlin
suspend fun signInWithEmailOtp() {
	supabase.auth.signInWith(OTP) {
		email = "example@email.com"
	}
}
```

</TabPanel>
</Tabs>

If the request was successful, you receive a response with `error: null` and a `data` object where both `user` and `session` are null. In this case you can let the user know to check their email inbox.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "user": null,
    "session": null
  },
  "error": null
}
```

## Verify OTP to create session

Provide an input field for the user to key in the one-time code. To verify the code and complete the user's sign in, call [verifyOtp()](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-verifyotp) with their email address, the code, and `type: "email"`:

```js
const {
  data: { session },
  error,
} = await supabase.auth.verifyOtp({
  email,
  token: '123456',
  type: 'email',
})
```

If successful the user will now be logged in and you should receive a valid session like:

```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJhdXRoZW50aWNhdGVkIiwiZXhwIjoxNjI3MjkxNTc3LCJzdWIiOiJmYTA2NTQ1Zi1kYmI1LTQxY2EtYjk1NC1kOGUyOTg4YzcxOTEiLCJlbWFpbCI6IiIsInBob25lIjoiNjU4NzUyMjAyOSIsImFwcF9tZXRhZGF0YSI6eyJwcm92aWRlciI6InBob25lIn0sInVzZXJfbWV0YWRhdGEiOnt9LCJyb2xlIjoiYXV0aGVudGljYXRlZCJ9.1BqRi0NbS_yr1f6hnr4q3s1ylMR3c1vkiJ4e_N55dhM",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "refresh_token": "LSp8LglPPvf0DxGMSj-vaQ",
  "user": {...}
}
```
