Magic links are a form of passwordless logins where users click on a link sent to their email address to log in to their accounts.
Magic links only work with email addresses. By default, a user can only request a magic link once every 60 seconds.

## Overview

Setting up Magic Link logins for your iEchor application.

- Add the login code to your application - [JavaScript](/docs/reference/javascript/introduction) | [Flutter](/docs/reference/dart/installing)

## Add Magic Link into your iEchor Project

1. For [Site URL](https://iechor.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/url-configuration), enter the final (hosted) URL of your app.
1. For [Auth Providers](https://iechor.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers), **enable email provider**.

## Add login code to your client app

<Admonition type="caution">

When making use of Magic Links with [the PKCE Flow](https://iechor.com/blog/supabase-auth-sso-pkce#introducing-pkce) do bear in mind that links can only be used in the same browser that they are sent from. Consequently, a magic link sent from Chrome on Desktop will be invalid if used on a Mobile Device.
