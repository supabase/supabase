# Auth SMTP

At present, you can trial the Supabase platform by sending up to **4** emails per hour via the built-in service. The default email service as a whole is offered on a best effort basis: we will do our best to maintain it and will review usage of the service on a regular basis to see if the email service should be continued.

As you progress toward production, you may find yourself wanting for a custom SMTP service in order to increase your limits. A custom SMTP server will allow you to set your own cap on the number of emails sent per hour.

Beyond rate limits, an SMTP server might also help with:

- Deliverability and Reputation Management
- Scalability
- Analytics and Tracking
- Compliance and Anti Spam measures

## How to Set up SMTP

Head over to the [Auth Settings Page](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/auth) and hit "Enable Custom SMTP" under the SMTP Provider section.

Fill in fields below with the relevant details obtained from your custom SMTP provider:
