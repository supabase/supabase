Supabase provides you with the option of adding captcha to your sign-in, sign-up, and password reset forms. This keeps your website safe from bots and malicious scripts. Supabase authentication has support for [hCaptcha](https://www.hcaptcha.com/).

## Sign up for hCaptcha

Go to the [hCaptcha](https://www.hcaptcha.com/) website and sign up for an account. On the welcome page, copy the **Sitekey** and **Secret key**.

If you have already signed up and didn't copy this information from the welcome page, you can get the **Secret key** from the settings page.

The **Sitekey** can be found in the **Settings** of the active site you created.

![sites_dashboard.png](/docs/img/guides/auth-captcha/sites_dashboard.png)

In the Settings page, look for the **Sitekey** section and copy the key.

## Enable hCaptcha protection for your Supabase project

Navigate to the **[Authentication](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/settings/auth)** page in the Supabase Dashboard and find the **Enable hCaptcha protection** toggle under the **Security and Protection** section.

Enter your hCaptcha **Secret key** and click **Save**.

## Add the hCaptcha frontend component

The frontend requires some changes to provide the captcha on-screen for the user. This example uses React and the hCaptcha React component, but hCaptcha can be used with any JavaScript framework.

Install `@hcaptcha/react-hcaptcha` in your project as a dependency.

```bash
npm install @hcaptcha/react-hcaptcha
```

Now import the `HCaptcha` component from the `@hcaptcha/react-hcaptcha` library.

```javascript
import HCaptcha from '@hcaptcha/react-hcaptcha'
```

Let’s create a empty state to store our `captchaToken`

```jsx
const [captchaToken, setCaptchaToken] = useState()
```

Now lets add the HCaptcha component to the JSX section of our code

```html
<HCaptcha />
```

We will pass it the sitekey we copied from the hCaptcha website as a property along with a onVerify property which takes a callback function. This callback function will have a token as one of its properties. Let's set the token in the state using `setCaptchaToken`

```jsx
<HCaptcha
  sitekey="your-sitekey"
  onVerify={(token) => { setCaptchaToken(token) }
/>
```

Now lets use the captcha token we receive in our Supabase signUp function.

```jsx
await supabase.auth.signUp({
  email,
  password,
  options: { captchaToken },
})
```

We will also need to reset the captcha challenge after we have made a call to the function above.

Create a ref to use on our HCaptcha component.

```jsx
const captcha = useRef()
```

Let's add a ref attribute on the `HCaptcha` component and assign the `captcha` constant to it.

```jsx
<HCaptcha
  ref={captcha}
  sitekey="your-sitekey"
  onVerify={(token) => {
    setCaptchaToken(token)
  }}
/>
```

Reset the `captcha` after the signUp function is called using the following code:

```jsx
captcha.current.resetCaptcha()
```

In order to test that this works locally we will need to use something like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or add an entry to your hosts file. You can read more about this in the [hCaptcha docs](https://docs.hcaptcha.com/#local-development).

Run the application and you should now be provided with a captcha challenge.
