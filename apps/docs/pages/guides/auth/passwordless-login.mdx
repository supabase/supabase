## What is passwordless login?

Passwordless login is a method of authentication that allows users to log in to a website or application without using a password. Instead of entering a password, the user may be asked to provide some other form of authentication, such as a one-time code sent via email or SMS, or by using a biometric factor like their fingerprint or facial recognition.

Passwordless login can provide a more convenient and secure way to authenticate users compared to traditional password-based login. By eliminating the need for users to remember and enter complex passwords, passwordless login can reduce the risk of password-related security breaches, such as password reuse and weak passwords. It can also make it easier for users to log in to their accounts, which can improve the user experience and increase engagement with your application.

There are several different methods of implementing passwordless login, and the specific steps and requirements may vary depending on the approach you choose. Some common methods include email or SMS-based one-time codes, biometric authentication, and magic links. You can learn more about these methods and how to implement passwordless login in your application by consulting the relevant documentation and tutorials.

## What are the benefits of passwordless login?

There are several benefits of implementing passwordless login in your applications, including:

1. **Improved user experience**: By eliminating the need for users to remember and enter complex passwords, passwordless login can make it easier and more convenient for users to log in to your application. This can improve the overall user experience and make it more enjoyable for users to interact with your application.

2. **Increased security**: Passwordless login can improve the security of your application by reducing the risk of password-related security breaches, such as password reuse and weak passwords. By using alternative forms of authentication, such as one-time codes or biometric factors, you can make it more difficult for unauthorized users to access your application.

3. **Reduced support burden**: Passwordless login can also help reduce the support burden for your team by eliminating the need to reset forgotten passwords or deal with other password-related issues. This can free up your team to focus on other important tasks and improve the efficiency of your operation.

4. **Increased registration and conversion rates**: By making the login process simpler and more convenient, passwordless login can also lead to increased registration and conversion rates for your application. This can help you attract more users and encourage them to take the desired actions within your application.

Overall, passwordless login can provide a more convenient and secure way to authenticate users, improve the user experience, increase security, reduce the support burden, and increase registration and conversion rates.

## Passwordless methods

### Email One Time Password (OTP)

Magic link passwordless login is a method of authentication that allows users to log in to a
website or application without using a password. Instead of entering a password, the user is sent
a "magic link" via email or SMS, which they can click or tap to log in to their account. You can
follow our MagicLink guide to find out more about implementing this method.
