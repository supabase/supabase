Passwordless login is a method of authentication that allows users to log in to a website or application without using a password. Instead of entering a password, the user may be asked to provide some other form of authentication, such as a one-time code sent via email or SMS, or by using a biometric factor like their fingerprint or facial recognition.

## Benefits

There are several benefits of implementing passwordless login in your applications:

1. **Improved user experience**: By eliminating the need for users to remember and enter complex passwords, passwordless login can make it easier and more convenient for users to log in to your application. This can improve the overall user experience and make it more enjoyable for users to interact with your application.

2. **Increased security**: Passwordless login can improve the security of your application by reducing the risk of password-related security breaches, such as password reuse and weak passwords. By using alternative forms of authentication, such as one-time codes or biometric factors, you can make it more difficult for unauthorized users to access your application.

3. **Reduced support burden**: Passwordless login can also help reduce the support burden for your team by eliminating the need to reset forgotten passwords or deal with other password-related issues. This can free up your team to focus on other important tasks and improve the efficiency of your operation.

## Set up Passwordless Login with Supabase Auth

Supabase supports passwordless logins through "magic links" (instead of entering a password, the user is sent
a link which they can click to log in to their account) and one-time passwords via SMS through several communications platforms. Follow the guides below to set up a passwordless login flow with Supabase Auth.
