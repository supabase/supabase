Supabase supports various forms of passwordless authentication:

- [Email Magic Link](/docs/guides/auth/passwordless-login/auth-magic-link)
- [Email one-time password (OTP)](/docs/guides/auth/passwordless-login/auth-email-otp)
- [SMS & WhatsApp one-time password (OTP)](/docs/guides/auth/phone-login)

## Benefits

There are several reasons why you might want to add passwordless login to your applications:

- **Improved user experience**: Eliminating the need for users to remember and enter complex passwords can make it easier and more convenient for users to log in to your application. This can improve the overall user experience and make it more enjoyable for users to interact with your application.

- **Increased security**: Passwordless login can improve the security of your application by reducing the risk of password-related security breaches, such as password reuse and weak passwords. By using alternative forms of authentication, such as one-time codes or biometric factors, you can make it more difficult for unauthorized users to access your application.

- **Reduced support burden**: Passwordless login can also help reduce the support burden for your team by eliminating the need to handle password recovery flows or deal with other password-related issues. This can free up your team to focus on other important tasks and improve the efficiency of your operation.
