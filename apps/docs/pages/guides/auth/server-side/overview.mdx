When using Supabase with server-side languages and frameworks - such as Next.js, SvelteKit and Remix - it is important to configure your Supabase client to use cookies for storing user sessions. We have developed an `@supabase/ssr` package to make this process as simple as possible. This package is currently in `beta`, and is likely to have breaking changes in the future.

## Framework Quickstarts

<div className="grid lg:grid-cols-12 gap-6 not-prose">
  {quickstarts.map((item) => {
    return (
      <Link href={`${item.href}`} key={item.title} passHref className={'col-span-4'}>
        <GlassPanel title={item.title} span="col-span-6" background={false} icon={item.icon}>
          {item.description}
        </GlassPanel>
      </Link>
    )
  })}
</div>

<Admonition type="note">

If you're currently using the [Auth Helpers package](https://github.com/supabase/auth-helpers), the [docs are still available](/docs/guides/auth/auth-helpers), however we recommend migrating to the new `@supabase/ssr` package as this will be the recommended path moving forward.
