Supabase provides a globally distributed cluster of [Realtime](https://github.com/supabase/realtime) servers that enable the following functionality:

- [Broadcast](/docs/guides/realtime/broadcast): Send ephemeral messages from client to clients with low latency.
- [Presence](/docs/guides/realtime/presence): Track and synchronize shared state between clients.
- [Postgres Changes](/docs/guides/realtime/postgres-changes): Listen to Postgres database changes and send them to authorized clients.
