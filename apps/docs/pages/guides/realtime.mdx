Supabase provides a globally distributed cluster of [Realtime](https://github.com/supabase/realtime) servers that enable the following functionality:

- [Broadcast](/docs/guides/realtime/broadcast): Send ephemeral messages from client to clients with low latency.
- [Presence](/docs/guides/realtime/presence): Track and synchronize shared state between clients.
- [Postgres Changes](/docs/guides/realtime/postgres-changes): Listen to Postgres database changes and send them to authorized clients.

A [channel](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/channels.html) is the basic building block of Realtime and narrows the scope of data flow to subscribed clients. You can think of a channel as a chatroom where participants are able to see who's online and send and receive messages; similar to a Discord or Slack channel.

All clients can connect to a channel and take advantage of the built-in features, Broadcast and Presence, while extensions, like Postgres Changes, must be enabled prior to use.
