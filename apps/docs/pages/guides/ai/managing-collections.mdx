A collection is a group of vector records managed by the `vecs` Python library. Records can be added to or updated in a collection. Collections can be queried at any time, but should be indexed for scalable query performance.

Supabase provides a [Python client](/docs/guides/ai/vecs-python-client) called `vecs` for managing unstructured vector stores in Postgres. If you come from a data science background, this unstructured data approach will feel familiar. If you are more interested in a structured data approach, see [Vector columns](/docs/guides/ai/vector-columns) or read our guide on [Structured & Unstructured Embeddings](/docs/guides/ai/structured-unstructured).

Under the hood `vecs` will manage the necessary Postgres tables and columns to store and query your collections.

## API

Find the full API in the [official API docs](https://supabase.github.io/vecs/api).

### Connecting

Before you can interact with vecs, create the client to communicate with Postgres.

```python
import vecs

DB_CONNECTION = "postgresql://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<db_name>"

# create vector store client
vx = vecs.create_client(DB_CONNECTION)
```

### Create collection

You can create a collection to store vectors specifying the collection's name and the number of dimensions in the vectors you intend to store.

```python
docs = vx.create_collection(name="docs", dimension=3)
```

If another collection exists with the same name,

### Get an existing collection

To access a previously created collection, use `get_collection` to retrieve it by name

```python
docs = vx.get_collection(name="docs")
```

### Upserting vectors

`vecs` combines the concepts of "insert" and "update" into "upsert". Upserting records adds them to the collection if the `id` is not present, or updates the existing record if the `id` does exist.

```python
# add records to the collection
docs.upsert(
    vectors=[
        (
         "vec0",           # the vector's identifier
         [0.1, 0.2, 0.3],  # the vector. list or np.array
         {"year": 1973}    # associated  metadata
        ),
        (
         "vec1",
         [0.7, 0.8, 0.9],
         {"year": 2012}
        )
    ]
)
```

### Create an index

Collections can be queried immediately after being created.
However, for good performance, the collection should be indexed after records have been upserted.

Indexes should be created **after** the collection has been populated with records. Building an index on an empty collection will significantly reduce recall. Once the index has been created you can still upsert new documents into the collection but you should rebuild the index if the size of the collection more than doubles.

Only one index may exist per-collection. By default, creating an index will replace any existing index.

To create an index:

```python
##
# INSERT RECORDS HERE
##

# index the collection to be queried by cosine distance
docs.create_index(measure=vecs.IndexMeasure.cosine_distance)
```

Available options for query `measure` are:

- `vecs.IndexMeasure.cosine_distance`
- `vecs.IndexMeasure.l2_distance`
- `vecs.IndexMeasure.max_inner_product`

which correspond to different methods for comparing query vectors to the vectors in the database.

If you aren't sure which to use, stick with the default (cosine_distance) by omitting the parameter i.e.: `docs.create_index()`.

<Admonition type="note">

The time required to create an index grows with the number of records and size of vectors. For a few thousand records expect sub-minute a response in under a minute. It may take a few minutes for larger collections.

### Query

Be aware that indexes are essential for good performance. If you do not create an index, every query will return a warning that includes the `IndexMeasure` you should index.

#### Basic

The simplest form of search is to provide a query vector.

```python
docs.query(
    query_vector=[0.4,0.5,0.6],  # required
    limit=5,                     # number of records to return
    filters={},                  # metadata filters
    measure="cosine_distance",   # distance measure to use
    include_value=False,         # should distance measure values be returned?
    include_metadata=False,      # should record metadata be returned?
)
```

Which returns a list of vector record `ids`.

#### Metadata Filtering

The metadata that is associated with each record can also be filtered during a query.

As an example, `{"year": {"$eq": 2005}}` filters a `year` metadata key to be equal to 2005

In context:

```python
docs.query(
    query_vector=[0.4,0.5,0.6],
    filters={"year": {"$eq": 2012}}, # metadata filters
)
```
