Most vector stores treat embeddings like NoSQL, unstructured data. Supabase is flexible enough to fit either a structured or an unstructured approach. Compare these code snippets:

Structured (SQL):

```sql
create table (
  id serial primary key,
  content text,
  embedding vector(1536),
  metadata jsonb
);
```

Unstructured (Python):

```py
import vecs

docs = vx.create_collection(name="docs", dimension=1536)
```

Both of these create a table where you can store your embeddings and some metadata.

## Choosing the right model

- Structured embeddings are typically colocated with some content that's already stored in your database.
- Unstructured embeddings are typically defined at Runtime, better-suited for a large body of external content.

Both approaches are fine, and depending on your use-case.

## Engineering for scale

Because the data source for vectors can be extremely large, as you grow you will want to run your Vector workload across several databases (sometimes called "pods"). This allows each collection to scale independently.
