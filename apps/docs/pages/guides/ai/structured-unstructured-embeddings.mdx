Most vector stores treat embeddings like NoSQL, unstructured data. Supabase is flexible enough to fit either a structured or an unstructured approach.

Compare these code snippets:

## Structured

```sql
create table (
  id serial primary key,
  content text,
  embedding vector(1536),
  metadata jsonb
);
```

A structured approach is usually defined in SQL, and managed via Database Migrations.

## Unstructured

```py
import vecs

docs = vx.create_collection(name="docs", dimension=1536)
```

An unstructured approach is usually defined in Python, and has a much looser table definition.

## Choosing the right model

Both approaches create a table where you can store your embeddings and some metadata. You should choose the best approach for your use-case.

- Structured embeddings are typically co-located with some content that is already stored in your database.
- Unstructured embeddings are typically defined at runtime, better-suited for a large body of external content.

Both approaches are fine, and the one you should choose depends on your use-case.
