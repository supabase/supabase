Once your vector table starts to grow, you will likely want to add an index to speed up queries. Without indexes, you'll be performing a sequential scan which can be a resource-intensive operation when you have many records.

## Choosing an index

Today `pgvector` supports two types of indexes:

- [HNSW](/docs/guides/ai/vector-indexes/hnsw-indexes)
- [IVFFlat](/docs/guides/ai/vector-indexes/ivf-indexes)

In general we recommend using [HNSW](/docs/guides/ai/vector-indexes/hnsw-indexes) because of its [performance gain](/blog/increase-performance-pgvector-hnsw#hnsw-performance-1536-dimensions) and [robustness against changing data](/docs/guides/ai/vector-indexes/hnsw-indexes#when-should-you-create-hnsw-indexes).

## Distance operators

The type of index required depends on the distance operator you are using. `pgvector` includes 3 distance operators:

| Operator | Description            | [**Operator class**](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createopclass.html) |
| -------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `<->`    | Euclidean distance     | `vector_l2_ops`                                                                      |
| `<#>`    | negative inner product | `vector_ip_ops`                                                                      |
| `<=>`    | cosine distance        | `vector_cosine_ops`                                                                  |

Use the following SQL commands to create an index for the operator(s) used in your queries.

Currently vectors with up to 2,000 dimensions can be indexed.

If you are using the `vecs` Python library, follow the instructions in [Managing collections](/docs/guides/ai/managing-collections#create-an-index) to create indexes.
