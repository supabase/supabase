This guide will help you choose the right Compute Add-on for your workload. We'll provide general guidance, as it is impossible to provide specific instructions for every possible use case. The goal is to give you a starting point from which you can make your own benchmarks and optimizations.

Note that it is only useful for index searches, not for sequential scans. Sequential scans will result to significantly higher latencies and lower throughput, but will guarantee 100% precision and will not be RAM bound. Therefore it is possible to use a smaller plan for sequential scans.

For more information about engineering at scale, see our [Engineering for Scale](/docs/guides/ai/engineering-for-scale) guide.

## Simple workloads

We've run a set of benchmarks using

- The [dbpedia-entities-openai-1M](https://huggingface.co/datasets/KShivendu/dbpedia-entities-openai-1M) dataset. This dataset contains 1,000,000 embeddings for text, with each embedding being 1536 dimensions made using OpenAI API.
- The [gist-960-angular](http://corpus-texmex.irisa.fr/) dataset. This dataset contains 1,000,000 embeddings for images, with each embedding being 960 dimensions.
- The [GloVe Reddit comments](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) dataset, which contains 1,623,397 embeddings for words, with each embedding being 512 dimensions.

We used [Vecs](https://github.com/supabase/vecs) to create a collection, upload the embeddings to a single table, and create an `inner-product` index for the embedding column. We then ran a series of queries to measure the performance of different compute add-ons:

For 1,000,000 vectors 10 probes results to precision of 0.91. And for 500,000 vectors and below 10 probes results to precision in the range of 0.95 - 0.99. To increase precision, you need to increase the number of probes.

<Admonition type="note">

It is possible to upload more vectors to a single table if Memory allows it (for example, 4XL plan and higher for OpenAI embeddings). But it will affect the performance of the queries: RPS will be lower, and latency will be higher. Scaling should be almost linear, but it is recommended to benchmark your workload to find the optimal number of vectors per table and per database instance.

</Admonition>

## Methodology

We follow techniques outlined in the [ANN Benchmarks](https://github.com/erikbern/ann-benchmarks) methodology. A Python test runner is responsible for uploading the data, creating the index, and running the queries. The pgvector engine is implemented using [vecs](https://github.com/supabase/vecs), a Python client for pgvector.

  <img
    alt="multi database"
    className="hidden dark:block"
    src="/docs/img/ai/instance-type/vecs-benchmark--dark.png"
  />
</div>

Each test is run for a minimum of 30-40 minutes. They include a series of experiments executed at different concurrency levels to measure the engine's performance under different load types. The results are then averaged.

As a general recommendation, we suggest using a concurrency level of 5 or more for most workloads and 30 or more for high-load workloads.
