You have two options for scaling your vector workload:

1. Increase the size of your database. This guide will help you choose the right size for your workload.
2. Spread your workload across multiple databases. You can find more details about this approach in [Engineering for Scale](engineering-for-scale).

## Dimensionality

The number of dimensions in your embeddings is the most important factor in choosing the right Compute Add-on. In general, the lower the dimensionality the better the performance. We've provided guidance for some of the more common embedding dimensions below. For each benchmark, we used [Vecs](https://github.com/supabase/vecs) to create a collection, upload the embeddings to a single table, and create an `inner-product` index for the embedding column. We then ran a series of queries to measure the performance of different compute add-ons:

### 1536 Dimensions

This benchmark uses the [dbpedia-entities-openai-1M](https://huggingface.co/datasets/KShivendu/dbpedia-entities-openai-1M) dataset, which contains 1,000,000 embeddings of text. Each embedding is 1536 dimensions created with the [OpenAI Embeddings API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings).

<Admonition type="note">

It is possible to upload more vectors to a single table if Memory allows it (for example, 4XL plan and higher for OpenAI embeddings). But it will affect the performance of the queries: RPS will be lower, and latency will be higher. Scaling should be almost linear, but it is recommended to benchmark your workload to find the optimal number of vectors per table and per database instance.

</Admonition>

## Performance tips

There are various ways to improve your pgvector performance. Here are some tips:

### Pre-warming your database

It's useful to execute a few thousand “warm-up” queries before going into production. This helps help with RAM utilization. This can also help to determine that you've selected the right instance size for your workload.

### Increase the number of lists

You can increase the Requests per Second by increasing the number of `lists`. This also has an important caveat: building the index takes longer with more lists.

## Benchmark Methodology

We follow techniques outlined in the [ANN Benchmarks](https://github.com/erikbern/ann-benchmarks) methodology. A Python test runner is responsible for uploading the data, creating the index, and running the queries. The pgvector engine is implemented using [vecs](https://github.com/supabase/vecs), a Python client for pgvector.

  <img
    alt="multi database"
    className="hidden dark:block"
    src="/docs/img/ai/instance-type/vecs-benchmark--dark.png"
  />
</div>

Each test is run for a minimum of 30-40 minutes. They include a series of experiments executed at different concurrency levels to measure the engine's performance under different load types. The results are then averaged.

As a general recommendation, we suggest using a concurrency level of 5 or more for most workloads and 30 or more for high-load workloads.
