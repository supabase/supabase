Supabase provides a Python client called [`vecs`](https://github.com/supabase/vecs) for managing unstructured vector stores. This client provides a set of useful tools for creating and querying collections in PostgreSQL using the [pgvector](/docs/guides/database/extensions/pgvector) extension.

## Quick start

Let's see how Vecs works using a local database. Make sure you have the Supabase CLI [installed](/docs/guides/cli#installation) on your machine.

### Initialize your project

Start a local Postgres instance in any folder using the `init` and `start` commands. Make sure you have Docker running!

```bash
# Initialize your project
supabase init

# Start Postgres
supabase start
```

### Create a collection

Inside a Python shell, run the following commands to create a new collection called "docs", with 3 dimensions.

```py
import vecs

# create vector store client
vx = vecs.create_client("postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54322/postgres")

# create a collection of vectors with 3 dimensions
docs = vx.create_collection(name="docs", dimension=3)
```

### Add embeddings

Now we can insert some embeddings into our "docs" collection using the `usert()` command:

```py
import vecs

# create vector store client
docs = vecs.get_collection(name="docs")

# a collection of vectors with 3 dimensions
vectors=[
  ("vec0", [0.1, 0.2, 0.3], {"year": 1973}),
  ("vec1", [0.7, 0.8, 0.9], {"year": 2012})
]

# insert our vectors
docs.upsert(vectors=vectors)
```

### Query the collection

You can now query the collection to retrieve a relevant match:

```py
import vecs

docs = vecs.get_collection(name="docs")

# query the collection filtering metadata for "year" = 2012
docs.query(
    query_vector=[0.4,0.5,0.6],      # required
    limit=1,                         # number of records to return
    filters={"year": {"$eq": 2012}}, # metadata filters
)
```

## API

Find the full API in the [official API docs](https://supabase.github.io/vecs/api).

### Connecting

Before you can interact with vecs, create the client to communicate with Postgres.

```python
import vecs

DB_CONNECTION = "postgresql://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<db_name>"

# create vector store client
vx = vecs.create_client(DB_CONNECTION)
```

### Create collection

You can create a collection to store vectors specifying the collections name and the number of dimensions in the vectors you intend to store.

```python
docs = vx.create_collection(name="docs", dimension=3)
```

If another collection exists with the same name,

### Get an existing collection

To access a previously created collection, use `get_collection` to retrieve it by name

```python
docs = vx.get_collection(name="docs")
```

### Upserting vectors

`vecs` combines the concepts of "insert" and "update" into "upsert". Upserting records adds them to the collection if the `id` is not present, or updates the existing record if the `id` does exist.

```python
# add records to the collection
docs.upsert(
    vectors=[
        (
         "vec0",           # the vector's identifier
         [0.1, 0.2, 0.3],  # the vector. list or np.array
         {"year": 1973}    # associated  metadata
        ),
        (
         "vec1",
         [0.7, 0.8, 0.9],
         {"year": 2012}
        )
    ]
)
```

### Create an index

Collections can be queried immediately after being created.
However, for good performance, the collection should be indexed after records have been upserted.

Indexes should be created **after** the collection has been populated with records. Building an index on an empty collection will result in significantly reduced recall. Once the index has been created you can still upsert new documents into the collection but you should rebuild the index if the size of the collection more than doubles.

Only one index may exist per-collection. By default, creating an index will replace any existing index.

To create an index:

```python
##
# INSERT RECORDS HERE
##

# index the collection to be queried by cosine distance
docs.create_index(measure=vecs.IndexMeasure.cosine_distance)
```

Available options for query `measure` are:

- `vecs.IndexMeasure.cosine_distance`
- `vecs.IndexMeasure.l2_distance`
- `vecs.IndexMeasure.max_inner_product`

which correspond to different methods for comparing query vectors to the vectors in the database.

If you aren't sure which to use, stick with the default (cosine_distance) by omitting the parameter i.e.: `docs.create_index()`.

<Admonition type="note">

The time required to create an index grows with the number of records and size of vectors. For a few thousand records expect sub-minute a response in under a minute. It may take a few minutes for larger collections.

</Admonition>

### Query

Be aware that indexes are essential for good performance. If you do not create an index, every query will return a warning that includes the `IndexMeasure` you should index.

#### Basic

The simplest form of search is to provide a query vector.

```python
docs.query(
    query_vector=[0.4,0.5,0.6],  # required
    limit=5,                     # number of records to return
    filters={},                  # metadata filters
    measure="cosine_distance",   # distance measure to use
    include_value=False,         # should distance measure values be returned?
    include_metadata=False,      # should record metadata be returned?
)
```

Which returns a list of vector record `ids`.

#### Metadata Filtering

The metadata that is associated with each record can also be filtered during a query.

As an example, `{"year": {"$eq": 2005}}` filters a `year` metadata key to be equal to 2005

In context:

```python
docs.query(
    query_vector=[0.4,0.5,0.6],
    filters={"year": {"$eq": 2012}}, # metadata filters
)
```
