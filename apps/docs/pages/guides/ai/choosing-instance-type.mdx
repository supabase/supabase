This guide will help you choose the right instance type for your workload. We'll provide general guidance, as it is impossible to provide specific instructions for every possible use case. The goal is to give you a starting point from which you can make your own benchmarks and optimizations.

For more information about engineering at scale, see our [Engineering for Scale](/docs/guides/ai/engineering-for-scale) guide.

## Simple workloads

We've run a set of benchmarks using the [gist-960-angular](http://corpus-texmex.irisa.fr/) dataset. This dataset contains 1,000,000 embeddings for images, with each embedding being 960 dimensions.

We used [Vecs](https://github.com/supabase/vecs) to create a collection, upload the embeddings to a single table, and create an `inner-product` index for the embedding column. We then ran a series of queries to measure the performance of different instance types:

### Results

The number of vectors in `gist-960-angular` was cut to fit the instance size.

<Admonition type="note">

It is possible to upload more than 1,000,000 vectors to a single table if Memory allows it (for example, 2XL instance and higher). But it will affect the performance of the queries: RPS will be lower, and latency will be higher. Scaling should be almost linear, but it is recommended to benchmark your workload to find the optimal number of vectors per table and per instance.

## Methodology

We follow techniques outlined in the [ANN Benchmarks](https://github.com/erikbern/ann-benchmarks) methodology. A Python test runner is responsible for uploading the data, creating the index, and running the queries. The pgvector engine is implemented using [vecs](https://github.com/supabase/vecs), a Python client for pgvector.

  />
</div>

Each test is run for a minimum of 30-40 minutes. They include a series of experiments executed at different concurrency levels to measure the engine's performance under different load types. The results are then averaged.

As a general recommendation, we suggest using a concurrency level of 5 or more for most workloads and 30 or more for high-load workloads.

## Future benchmarks

We'll continue to add more benchmarks on datasets consisting of different vector dimensions, number of `lists` in the index, and number of `probes` in the index. Stay tuned for more information about how it may affect the performance and precision of your queries.
