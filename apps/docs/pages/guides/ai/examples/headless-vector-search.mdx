  subtitle: 'A toolkit to perform vector similarity search on your knowledge base embeddings.',
  breadcrumb: 'AI Examples',
}

Provides a vector/similarity search for any documentation site or knowledge base. It's headless, so that you can integrate it into your existing website.

This toolkit consists of 2 parts:

- The [Headless Vector Search](https://github.com/supabase/headless-vector-search) template which you can deploy in your own organization.
- A [GitHub Action](https://github.com/supabase/embeddings-generator) which will ingest your markdown files, convert them to embeddings, and store them in your database.

## Tech stack

- Supabase: Database & Edge Functions.
- OpenAI: Embeddings and completions.
- GitHub Actions: for ingesting your markdown docs.
