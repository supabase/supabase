Supabase provides the default `postgres` role to all instances deployed. Superuser access is not given as it allows destructive operations to be performed on the database.

To ensure you are not impacted by this, additional privileges are granted to the `postgres` user and we have developed Supautils to provide helper functions for certain privileged operations.

However, this does mean that some operations, typically requiring `superuser` privileges are not available on Supabase. These are documented below.

## Unsupported operations

- `CREATE ROLE ... WITH REPLICATION`
- `CREATE SUBSCRIPTION`
- `CREATE EVENT TRIGGER`
- `COPY ... FROM PROGRAM`
- `ALTER USER ... WITH SUPERUSER`
