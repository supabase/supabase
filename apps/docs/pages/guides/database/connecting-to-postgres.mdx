Supabase provides several options for programmatically connecting to your Postgres database:

1. Programmatic access using the Data APIs
1. Direct connections using the built-in Postgres connection system
1. Connection pooling for scalable connections

## Data APIs

Supabase provides auto-updating Data APIs. These are the easiest way to get started if you are managing data (fetching, inserting, updating). We provide several types of API to suit your preferences:

- [REST](/docs/guides/api): interact with your database through a REST interface.
- [GraphQL](/docs/guides/graphql/api): interact with your database through a GraphQL interface.
- [Realtime](/docs/guides/realtime#realtime-api): listen to database changes over websockets.

## Direct connections

Every Supabase project provides a full Postgres database. You can connect to the database using any tool which supports Postgres. Direct connections are on port `5432`. You can find the connection string in the [Database settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/database) inside the dashboard:

1. Go to the `Settings` section.
2. Click `Database`.
3. Find your Connection Info and Connection String.

## Connection pooler

Every Supabase project comes with a connection pooler for managing connections to your Postgres database. A connection pooler is useful for managing a large number of _temporary_ connections - for example, if you are using Prisma, Drizzle, Kysely, or anything deployed to a Serverless environment (AWS Lambdas or Edge Functions). You can find the connection pool config in the [Database settings](/dashboard/project/_/settings/database) inside the dashboard:

1. Go to the `Settings` section.
2. Click `Database`.
3. Find your Connection Info and Connection String. Connection pooling is on port `6543`.

## Choosing a connection method

- The Data APIs provide programmatic access and have [built-in connection pooling](https://postgrest.org/en/stable/references/connection_pool.html). You can use these for all browser and application interactions. We recommend using these wherever possible.
- A "direct connection" is Postgres' native connection system. You should use this for tools which are always alive - usually installed on a long-running server, like Node.js, Ruby, Python, etc.
- A "connection pooler" is a tool which keeps connections "alive". You should use this for serverless functions and tools which disconnect from the database frequently, like Prisma, Drizzle, Kysely, etc.

Why would you use a connection pool? Primarily because the way that Postgres handles connections isn't very scalable for a large number of _temporary_ connections. You can use these simple questions to determine which connection method to use:

- Are you connecting to a database and _maintaining_ a connection? If yes, use a direct connection.
- Are you connecting to your database and then _disconnecting_ immediately (e.g. a serverless environment)? If yes, use a connection pool.

## Connecting with SSL

You should connect to your database using SSL wherever possible, to prevent snooping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

You can obtain your connection info and Server root certificate from your application's dashboard:

## How connection pooling works

A "connection pool" is a system (external to Postgres) which manages Postgres connections.

When a client makes a request, the pooler "allocates" an available connection to the client. When the client transaction or session is completed the connection is returned to the pool and is free to be used by another client.

![Connection pooling](/docs/img/guides/database/connection-pool.png)

There are several pool modes, each handling connections differently:

### Session

When a new client connects, a connection is assigned to the client until it disconnects. Afterward, the connection is returned back to the pool.

All Postgres features can be used with this option.

### Transaction

This is the suggested option for serverless functions. A connection is assigned to the client for the duration of a transaction. Two consecutive transactions from the same client could be executed over two different connections. Some session-based Postgres features such as prepared statements are not available with this option.

### Statement

This is the most granular option. Connections are returned to the pool after every statement. Transactions with multiple statements are not allowed. This is best used when `AUTOCOMMIT` is in use.

### Supavisor vs PgBouncer

Supabase previously used PgBouncer for connection pooling. We have now deprecated PgBouncer in favor of Supavisor. Supavisor is available on all new and existing projects.

[Supavisor](https://github.com/supabase/supavisor) is a new connection pooler by Supabase that runs on a high-availability cluster, segregated from your database. This means more resources are available for your database. No Application changes are required to switch from PgBouncer to Supavisor, you simply need to choose the new connection string from the "Connection Pooling" section on [Database settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/database).

On 15th January 2024 PgBouncer will be disabled. Additionally, your Supabase database domain (db.projectref.supabase.co) will start resolving to an IPv6 address. No changes are required if your network supports IPv6. Otherwise, update your applications to use Supavisor which will continue to support IPv4 connections.
