}

[pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector/) is a PostgreSQL extension for vector similarity search. It can also be used for storing [embeddings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding).

## Concepts

### Vector similarity

Vector similarity refers to a measure of the similarity between two related items. For example, if you have a list of products, you can use vector similarity to find similar products. To do this, you need to convert each product into a "vector" of numbers, using a mathematical model. You can use a similar model for text, images, and other types of data. Once all of these vectors are stored in the database, you can use vector similarity to find similar items.

### Embeddings

This is particularly useful if you're building on top of OpenAI's [GPT-3](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-apps/). You can create and store [embeddings](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings) which match the GPT model you're using.

## Usage

### Enable the extension

<Tabs
  scrollable
  size="small"
  type="underlined"
  defaultActiveId="dashboard"
>
<TabPanel id="dashboard" label="Dashboard">

1. Go to the [Database](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/database/tables) page in the Dashboard.
2. Click on **Extensions** in the sidebar.
3. Search for "vector" and enable the extension.

</TabPanel>
<TabPanel id="sql" label="SQL">

```sql
 -- Example: enable the "vector" extension.
create extension vector
with
  schema extensions;

-- Example: disable the "vector" extension
drop
  extension if exists vector;
```

Even though the SQL code is `create extension`, this is the equivalent of "enabling the extension".
To disable an extension, call `drop extension`.

</TabPanel>
</Tabs>

## Usage

### Create a table to store vectors

```sql
create table posts (
  id serial primary key,
  title text not null,
  body text not null,
  embedding vector(1536)
);
```

### Storing a vector / embedding

In this example we'll generate a vector using the OpenAI API client, then store it in the database using the Supabase client.

```js
const title = 'First post!'
const body = 'Hello world!'

// Generate a vector using OpenAI
const embeddingResponse = await openai.createEmbedding({
  model: 'text-embedding-ada-002',
  input: body,
})
const [responseData] = embeddingResponse.data.data.

// Store the vector in Postgres
const { data, error } = await supabase.from('posts').insert({
  title,
  body,
  embedding: responseData.embedding,
})
```
