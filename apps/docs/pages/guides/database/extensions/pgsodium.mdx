[pgsodium](https://github.com/michelp/pgsodium) is a PostgreSQL
extension which provides SQL access to
[libsodium's](https://doc.libsodium.org/) high-level cryptographic
algorithms.

libsodium is a modern, easy-to-use software library for encryption,
decryption, signatures, password hashing, and more. It is a portable,
cross-compilable, installable, and packageable fork of the
[NaCl](http://nacl.cr.yp.to/) library, with a compatible but extended
API to improve usability even further.

Its goal is to provide all of the core operations needed to build
higher-level cryptographic tools. Sodium is cross-platform and
cross-language. It runs on many compilers and operating systems,
including Windows (with MinGW or Visual Studio, x86 and x86_64), iOS,
and Android. JavaScript and WebAssembly versions are also available
and fully supported. Furthermore, bindings for all common programming
languages are available and well-supported.

The design choices emphasize security and ease of use. But despite the
emphasis on high security, primitives are faster across-the-board than
most implementations.

pgsodium exposes the following libsodium APIs to SQL:

- [Generating Random Data](https://github.com/michelp/pgsodium/#generating-random-data)
- [Secret key cryptography](https://github.com/michelp/pgsodium/#secret-key-cryptography)
  - [Authenticated encryption](https://github.com/michelp/pgsodium/#authenticated-encryption)
  - [Authentication](https://github.com/michelp/pgsodium/#authentication)
- [Public key cryptography](https://github.com/michelp/pgsodium/#public-key-cryptography)
  - [Authenticated encryption](https://github.com/michelp/pgsodium/#authenticated-encryption-1)
  - [Public key signatures](https://github.com/michelp/pgsodium/#public-key-signatures)
  - [Sealed boxes](https://github.com/michelp/pgsodium/#sealed-boxes)
- [Hashing](https://github.com/michelp/pgsodium/#hashing)
- [Password hashing](https://github.com/michelp/pgsodium/#password-hashing)
- [Key Derivation](https://github.com/michelp/pgsodium/#key-derivation)
- [Key Exchange](https://github.com/michelp/pgsodium/#key-exchange)
- [HMAC512](https://github.com/michelp/pgsodium/#hmac512)
- [Advanced Stream API](https://github.com/michelp/pgsodium/#advanced-stream-api)
- [XChaCha20-SIV](https://github.com/michelp/pgsodium/#xchacha20-siv)
- [Signcryption](https://github.com/michelp/pgsodium/#signcryption)

It also enables some Postgres specific features including:

- [Server Key Management](https://github.com/michelp/pgsodium#server-key-management)
- [Transparent Column Encryption](https://github.com/michelp/pgsodium#transparent-column-encryption)
