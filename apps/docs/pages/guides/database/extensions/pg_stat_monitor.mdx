[pg_stat_monitor](https://github.com/percona/pg_stat_monitor) is query performance monitoring tool that provides query execution statistics in a SQL view named `pg_stat_monitor`. It tracks a superset of statistics available in [`pg_stat_statements`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgstatstatements.html). Some of the most useful features are:

- **Time Interval Grouping**: configurable time buckets to track query usage over time
- **Capture Parameters**: optionally track parameters passed into queries instead of generic placeholders e.g. `$1`
- **Query Plan**: store query plans used for execution

For more information on query optimization, check out the [query performance guide](/docs/guides/platform/performance#examining-query-performance).

## Enable the extension

<Tabs
  scrollable
  size="small"
  type="underlined"
  defaultActiveId="dashboard"
>
<TabPanel id="dashboard" label="Dashboard">

1. Go to the [Database](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/database/tables) page in the Dashboard.
2. Click on **Extensions** in the sidebar.
3. Search for "pg_stat_monitor" and enable the extension.

```sql
-- Enable the "pg_stat_monitor" extension
create extension pg_stat_monitor with schema extensions;

-- Disable the "pg_stat_monitor" extension
drop extension if exists pg_stat_monitor;
```

Even though the SQL code is `create extension`, this is the equivalent of "enabling the extension".
To disable an extension you can call `drop extension`.

It's good practice to create the extension within a separate schema (like `extensions`) to keep the `public` schema clean.

```sql
select * from extensions.pg_stat_monitor;

The following table shows a subset of available columns:

| Column Type                           | Description                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| bucket bigint                         | Data collection unit. The number shows what bucket in a chain a record belongs to                                            |
| bucket_start_time timestampz          | The start time of the bucket                                                                                                 |

| toplevel bool                         | True if the query was executed as a top-level statement (always true if pg_stat_statements.track is set to top)              |
| client_ip inet                        | The IP address of a client that ran the query                                                                                |
| queryid bigint                        | Hash code to identify identical normalized queries.                                                                          |
| planid text                           | An internally generated ID of a query plan                                                                                   |
| query_plan text                       | The sequence of steps used to execute a query. This parameter is only available when pgsm_enable_query_plan is enabled       |
| query text                            | Text of a representative statement                                                                                           |
| plans bigint                          | Number of times the statement was planned (if pg_stat_statements.track_planning is enabled, otherwise zero)                  |
| total_plan_time double precision      | Total time spent planning the statement, in milliseconds (if pg_stat_statements.track_planning is enabled, otherwise zero)   |
| min_plan_time double precision        | Minimum time spent planning the statement, in milliseconds (if pg_stat_statements.track_planning is enabled, otherwise zero) |

A full list of statistics is available in the [pg_stat_monitor docs](https://docs.percona.com/pg-stat-monitor/reference.html#postgresql-15).
