Postgres provides a set of sensible defaults for you database size. In some cases, these defaults can be updated. We do not recommend changing these defaults unless you know what you're doing.

## Timeouts

By default, Supabase limits the maximum statement execution time to _8 seconds_ for users accessing the API. Additionally, all users are subject to a global limit of _2 minutes_. This serves as a backstop against resource exhaustion due to either poorly written queries, or abusive usage.

### Changing the default timeout

The timeout values were picked as a reasonable default for the majority of use-cases, but can be modified using the [`alter role`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-alterrole.html) statement:

```sql
-- For API users
alter role authenticator set statement_timeout = '15s';
```

You can also update the statement timeout for a session:

```sql
set statement_timeout to 60000; -- 1 minute in milliseconds
```

### Statement Optimization

All Supabase projects come with the [`pg_stat_statements`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgstatstatements.html) extension installed, which tracks planning and execution statistics for all statements executed against it. These statistics can be used in order to diagnose the performance of your project.

This data can further be used in conjunction with the [`explain`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/using-explain.html) functionality of Postgres to optimize your usage.

## Managing Timezones

Every Supabase database is set to UTC timezone by default. We strongly recommend keeping it this way, even if your users are in a different location.
This is because it makes it much easier to calculate differences between timezones if you adopt the mental model that "everything in my database is in UTC time".

### Change timezone

<Tabs
  scrollable
  size="small"
  type="underlined"
  defaultActiveId="sql"
>
<TabPanel id="sql" label="SQL">

```sql
alter database postgres
set timezone to 'America/New_York';
```

</TabPanel>
</Tabs>

### Full list of timezones

Get a full list of timezones supported by your database. This will return the following columns:

- `name`: Time zone name
- `abbrev`: Time zone abbreviation
- `utc_offset`: Offset from UTC (positive means east of Greenwich)
- `is_dst`: True if currently observing daylight savings

<Tabs
  scrollable
  size="small"
  type="underlined"
  defaultActiveId="sql"
>
<TabPanel id="sql" label="SQL">

```sql
select name, abbrev, utc_offset, is_dst
from pg_timezone_names()
order by name;
```

</TabPanel>
</Tabs>

### Search for a specific timezone

Use `ilike` (case insensitive search) to find specific timezones.

<Tabs
  scrollable
  size="small"
  type="underlined"
  defaultActiveId="sql"
>
<TabPanel id="sql" label="SQL">

```sql
select *
from pg_timezone_names()
where name ilike '%york%';
```

</TabPanel>
</Tabs>
