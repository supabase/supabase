An index makes your Postgres queries faster. The index is like a "table of contents" for your data - a reference list which allows queries to quickly locate a row in a given table without needing to scan the entire table (which in large tables can take a long time).

Indexes can be structured in a few different ways. The type of index chosen depends on the values you are indexing. By far the most common index type, and the default in Postgres, is the B-Tree. A B-Tree is the generalized form of a binary search tree, where nodes can have more than two children.

Even though indexes improve query performance, the Postgres query planner may not always make use of a given index when choosing which optimizations to make. Additionally indexes come with some overhead - additional writes and increased storage - so it's useful to understand how and when to use indexes, if at all.

## Create an index

Let's take an example table:

```sql
create table persons (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  age int,
  height int,
  weight int,
  name text,
  deceased boolean
);
```

<Admonition>

All the queries in this guide can be run using the [SQL Editor](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/sql) in the Supabase Dashboard, or via `psql` if you're [connecting directly to the database](/docs/guides/database/connecting-to-postgres#direct-connections).

</Admonition>

We might want to frequently query users based on their age:

```sql
select name from persons where age = 32;
```

Without an index, Postgres will scan every row in the table to find equality matches on age.

You can verify this by doing an explain on the query:

```sql
explain select name from persons where age = 32;
```

Outputs:

```
Seq Scan on persons  (cost=0.00..22.75 rows=x width=y)
Filter: (age = 32)
```

To add a simple B-Tree index you can run:

```sql
create index idx_persons_age on persons (age);
```

<Admonition type="caution">

It can take a long time to build indexes on large datasets and the default behaviour of `create index` is to lock the table from writes.

Luckily Postgres provides us with `create index concurrently` which prevents blocking writes on the table, but does take a bit longer to build.

</Admonition>

Here is a simplified diagram of the index we just created (note that in practice, nodes actually have more than two children).

![B-Tree index example in Postgres](/docs/img/b-tree-example.png)

You can see that in any large data set, traversing the index to locate a given value can be done in much less operations (O(log n)) than compared to scanning the table one value at a time from top to bottom (O(n)).

## Partial indexes

If you are frequently querying a subset of rows then it may be more efficient to build a partial index. In our example, perhaps we only want to match on `age` where `deceased is false`. We could build a partial index:

```sql
create index idx_living_persons_age on persons (age)
where deceased is false;
```

## Ordering indexes

By default B-Tree indexes are sorted in ascending order, but sometimes you may want to provide a different ordering. Perhaps our application has a page featuring the top 10 oldest people. Here we would want to sort in descending order, and include `NULL` values last. For this we can use:

```sql
create index idx_persons_age_desc on persons (age desc nulls last);
```

## Reindexing

After a while indexes can become stale and may need rebuilding. Postgres provides a `reindex` command for this, but due to Postgres locks being placed on the index during this process, you may want to make use of the `concurrent` keyword.

```sql
reindex index concurrently idx_persons_age;
```

Alternatively you can reindex all indexes on a particular table:

```sql
reindex table concurrently persons;
```

Take note that `reindex` can be used inside a transaction, but `reindex [index/table] concurrently` cannot.
