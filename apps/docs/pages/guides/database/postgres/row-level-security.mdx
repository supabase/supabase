When you need granular authorization rules, nothing beats Postgres's [Row Level Security (RLS)](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-rowsecurity.html).

## Row Level Security in Supabase

RLS is incredibly powerful and flexible, allowing you to write complex SQL rules that fit your unique business needs. RLS can be [combined with Supabase Auth](/docs/guides/auth/row-level-security) for end-to-end user security from the browser to the database.

Alternatively, RLS can provide "[defence in depth](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_in_depth_(computing)>)" to protect your data from malicious actors if you're using your own tooling with the Postgres database we provide.

## Policies

[Policies](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createpolicy.html) are Postgres's rule engine. Policies are easy to understand once you get the hang of them. Each policy is attached to a table, and the policy is executed every time a table is accessed.

You can just think of them as adding a `WHERE` clause to every query. For example a policy like this ...

```sql
create policy "Individuals can view their own todos."
on todos for select
using ( auth.uid() = user_id );
```

.. would translate to this whenever a user tries to select from the todos table:

```sql
select *
from todos
where auth.uid() = todos.user_id;
-- Policy is implicitly added.
```

## Enabling Row Level Security

You can enable RLS for any table using the `enable row level security` command:

```sql
alter table "table_name" enable row level security;
```

Once you have enabled RLS, no data will be accessible until you create policies.

## Creating Policies

Policies are simply SQL logic that you attach to a Postgres table. You can attach as many policies as you want to each table.

Supabase provides some [helpers](/docs/guides/auth/row-level-security#helper-functions) that simplify RLS if you're using Supabase Auth. We'll use these helpers to illustrate some basic Policies:

### SELECT Policies

You can specify select policies with the `using` command.

Let's say you have a table called `profiles` in the public schema and you want enable read access to everyone.

```sql
-- 1. Create table
create table profiles (
  id uuid primary key,
  user_id references auth.users,
  avatar_url text
);

-- 2. Enable RLS
alter table profiles enable row level security;

-- 3. Create Policy
create policy "Public profiles are visible to everyone."
on profiles for select
to anon         -- the Postgres Role (recommended)
using ( true ); -- the actual Policy
```

Alternatively if you only wanted users to be able to see their own profiles:

```sql
create policy "Profiles are viewable by everyone."
on profiles
for select using ( auth.uid() = user_id );
```

### INSERT Policies

You can specify select policies with the `with check` command.

Let's say you have a table called `profiles` in the public schema and you only want users to be able to create a profile for themselves. In that case, we want to check their User ID matches the value that they are trying to insert:

```sql
-- 1. Create table
create table profiles (
  id uuid primary key,
  user_id references auth.users,
  avatar_url text
);

-- 2. Enable RLS
alter table profiles enable row level security;

-- 3. Create Policy
create policy "Users can create a profile."
on profiles for insert
to authenticated                    -- the Postgres Role (recommended)
using ( auth.id() = user_id );      -- the actual Policy
```

### UPDATE Policies

You can specify select policies with the `using` command.

Let's say you have a table called `profiles` in the public schema and you only want users to be able to update their own profile:

```sql
-- 1. Create table
create table profiles (
  id uuid primary key,
  user_id references auth.users,
  avatar_url text
);

-- 2. Enable RLS
alter table profiles enable row level security;

-- 3. Create Policy
create policy "Users can update their own profile."
on profiles for update
to authenticated                    -- the Postgres Role (recommended)
using ( auth.id() = user_id );      -- the actual Policy
```

### DELETE Policies

You can specify select policies with the `using` command.

Let's say you have a table called `profiles` in the public schema and you only want users to be able to delete their own profile:

```sql
-- 1. Create table
create table profiles (
  id uuid primary key,
  user_id references auth.users,
  avatar_url text
);

-- 2. Enable RLS
alter table profiles enable row level security;

-- 3. Create Policy
create policy "Users can delete a profile."
on profiles for delete
to authenticated                    -- the Postgres Role (recommended)
using ( auth.id() = user_id );      -- the actual Policy
```

## Bypassing Row Level Security

You can create [Postgres Roles](/docs/guides/database/postgres/roles) which can bypass Row Level Security using the "bypass RLS" privelege:

```sql
grant bypassrls on "table_name" to "role_name";
```

This can be useful for system-level access. You should _never_ share login credentials for any Postgres Role with this privelege.

## RLS Performance Recommendations

Every authorization system has an impact on Performance. While Row Level Security is powerful, the performance impact is important to keep in mind. This is especially true for queries that scan every row in a table - like many `select` operations, including those using limit, offset, and ordering.

Based on a series of [tests](https://github.com/GaryAustin1/RLS-Performance), we have a few recommendations for RLS:

### Add indexes

Make sure you've added [indexes](/docs/guides/database/postgres/indexes) on any columns used within the Policies which are not already indexed (or primary keys). For a Policy like this:

```sql
create policy "rls_test_select"
on test_table
to authenticated
using ( auth.uid() = user_id );
```

You can add an index like:

```sql
create index userid
on test_table
using btree (user_id);
```

### Call functions with `select`

You can use `select` statement to improve Policies that use Functions. For example, instead of this:

```sql
create policy "rls_test_select"
on test_table
to authenticated
using ( auth.uid() = user_id );
```

You can do:

```sql
create policy "rls_test_select"
on test_table
to authenticated
using ( (select auth.uid()) = user_id );
```

This method works well for JWT functions like `auth.uid()` and `auth.jwt()` as well as `security definer` Functions. Wrapping the function causes an initPlan to be run by the Postgres optimizer, which allows it to "cache" the results per-statement, rather than calling the function on each row.

### Add filters to every query

Policies are "implicit where clauses", so it's common to run `select` statements without any filters. This is a bad pattern for performance. Instead of doing this (JS client example):

```js
const { data } = supabase.from('table').select()
```

You should always add a filter:

```js
const { data } = supabase.from('table').select().eq('user_id', userId)
```

Even if this duplicates the contents of the Policy, Postgres can use the to construct a better query plan.

## Use security definer functions

A "security definer" function runs using the same role that _created_ the function. This means that if you create a role with a superuser (like `postgres`), then that function will have `bypassrls` priveleges. For example, if you had a policy like this:

```sql
create policy "rls_test_select"
on test_table
to authenticated
using (
  exists (
    select 1 from roles_table
    where auth.uid() = user_id and role = 'good_role'
  )
);
```

We can instead create a `security definer` function which can scan `roles_table` without any RLS penalties:

```sql
create function private.has_good_role()
returns boolean
language plpgsql
security definer -- will run as the creator
as $$
begin
  return exists (
    select 1 from roles_table
    where auth.uid() = user_id and role = 'good_role'
  )
end;
$$;

-- Update our policy to use this function:
create policy "rls_test_select"
on test_table
to authenticated
using ( private.has_good_role() );
```

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Admonition type="caution">
Security-definer functions should never be created in a schema in the "Exposed schemas" inside your [API settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/api)`.
