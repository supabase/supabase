Extensions are exactly as they sound - they "extend" the database with functionality which isn't part of the Postgres core.
Supabase has pre-installed some of the most useful open source extensions.

### Enable and disable extensions

<Tabs
  scrollable
  size="small"
  type="underlined"
  defaultActiveId="dashboard"
>
<TabPanel id="dashboard" label="Dashboard">

1. Go to the [Database](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/database/tables) page in the Dashboard.
2. Click **Extensions** in the sidebar.
3. Enable or disable an extension.

</TabPanel>
<TabPanel id="sql" label="SQL">

```sql
 -- Example: enable the "pgtap" extension and ensure it is installed
create extension pgtap
with
  schema extensions;

-- Example: disable the "pgtap" extension
drop
  extension pgtap;
```

Even though the SQL code is `create extension`, this is the equivalent of "enabling the extension".
To disable an extension call `drop extension`.

</TabPanel>
</Tabs>

<Admonition type="note">

Most extensions are installed under the `extensions` schema, which is accessible to public by default. To avoid namespace pollution, we do not recommend creating other entities in the `extensions` schema.

If you need to restrict user access to tables managed by extensions, we recommend creating a separate schema for installing that specific extension.

Some extensions can only be created under a specific schema, for eg. `postgis_tiger_geocoder` extension creates a schema named `tiger`. Before enabling such extensions, make sure you have not created a conflicting schema with the same name.

### Full list of extensions

Supabase is pre-configured with over 50 extensions. You can also install your own SQL extensions directly in the database through our SQL editor.
