Extensions are exactly as they sound - they "extend" the database with functionality which isn't part of the Postgres core.
Supabase has pre-installed some of the most useful open source extensions.

### Enable and disable extensions

```sql
-- Example: enable the "pgtap" extension and ensure it is installed
create extension pgtap with schema extensions;

-- Example: disable the "pgtap" extension
drop extension pgtap;
```

Even though the SQL code is `create extension`, this is the equivalent of "enabling the extension".
To disable an extension call `drop extension`.

<Admonition type="caution">

Enabling some extensions with `create extension <extension-name> with schema extensions` may lead to permission issues (e.g., `dblink`, `http`, `pg_cron`).
