Your Postgres database is the core of your Supabase project, so it's important that it has a strong, secure password at all times.

If you use special symbols in your postgres password, you must remember to [percent-encode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding) your password later if using the postgres connection string e.g. `postgresql://postgres:p%3Dword@db.cvwawazfelidkloqmbma.supabase.co:5432/postgres`

## Changing your project password

When you created your project you were also asked to enter a password. This is actually the password for your database, specifically for the `postgres` user.
You can update this from the Dashboard under the [database settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/database) page.

## Creating a secure password

It's absolutely critical that you store your customers' data safely. Here are some tips for creating a secure password.

- Use a password manager to generate it.
- Make a long password (12 characters at least).
- Don't use any common dictionary words.
- Use both upper and lower case characters, numbers, and special symbols.
