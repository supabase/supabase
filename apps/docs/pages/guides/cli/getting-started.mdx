}

You can use the Supabase CLI to run the entire Supabase stack locally on your machine, simply by running `supabase init` (to create a new local project) and then `supabase start`.

The Supabase CLI provides tools to develop your project locally, deploy to the Supabase Platform, handle database migrations, and generate types directly from your database schema.

## Installing the Supabase CLI

<TabPanel id="npm" label="npm">

Install the CLI as dev dependency via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supabase):

```sh
npm install supabase --save-dev
```

Run the CLI by prefixing each command with `npx` (only applicable when installing through `npm`):

```sh
npx supabase <command>
```

Install the CLI with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```sh
brew install supabase/tap/supabase
```

</TabPanel>
<TabPanel id="windows" label="Windows">

Install the CLI with [Scoop](https://scoop.sh):

```powershell
scoop bucket add supabase https://github.com/supabase/scoop-bucket.git
scoop install supabase
```

The CLI is available through [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) and Linux packages.

#### Homebrew

```sh
brew install supabase/tap/supabase
```

#### Linux packages

Linux packages are provided in [Releases](https://github.com/supabase/cli/releases).
To install, download the `.apk`/`.deb`/`.rpm` file depending on your package manager
and run one of the following:

- `sudo apk add --allow-untrusted <...>.apk`
- `sudo dpkg -i <...>.deb`
- `sudo rpm -i <...>.rpm`

## Updating the Supabase CLI

When a new [version](https://github.com/supabase/cli/releases) is released, you can update the CLI using the same methods.

<Tabs

  type="underlined"
  defaultActiveId="npm"
>
<TabPanel id="npm" label="npm">

```sh
npm update supabase --save-dev
```

</TabPanel>
<TabPanel id="macos" label="macOS">

```sh
brew upgrade supabase
```

</TabPanel>
<TabPanel id="windows" label="Windows">

```powershell
scoop update supabase
```

</TabPanel>
<TabPanel id="linux" label="Linux">

```sh
brew upgrade supabase
```

</TabPanel>
</Tabs>

If you have any Supabase containers running locally, remember to restart them after upgrading to use the new features.

```bash
supabase stop --no-backup
supabase start
```

## Running Supabase locally

Inside the folder where you want to create your project, run:

```bash
supabase init
```

This will create a new `supabase` folder. It's safe to commit this folder to your version control system.

Now, to start the Supabase stack, run:

```bash
supabase start
```

This takes time on your first run because the CLI needs to download the local Docker images. The CLI includes the entire Supabase toolset, and a few additional images that are useful for local development (like a local SMTP server and a database diff tool).

The local development environment includes Supabase Studio, a graphical interface for working with your database, running by default on [localhost:54323](http://localhost:54323).

## Stopping local services

When you are finished working on your Supabase project, you can stop the stack with:

```bash
supabase stop
```
