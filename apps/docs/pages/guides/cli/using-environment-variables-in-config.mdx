}

The Supabase CLI is capable of utilizing environment variables stored in our project's root directory's `.env` file within the `config.toml` file.

We can reference the environment variable by using the `env()` function.

Inside of our `.env` file we add the environment variable as we normally would
```env
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=""
GITHUB_SECRET=""
```

And then reference them inside of our `config.toml`
```toml
[auth.external.github]
enabled = true
client_id = "env(GITHUB_CLIENT_ID)"
secret = "env(GITHUB_SECRET)"
# Overrides the default auth redirectUrl.
redirect_uri = ""
```

These same environment variables will be referenced by the `supabase start` command from the Supabase CLI.
