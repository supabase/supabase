}

The Supabase CLI uses [Inbucket](https://github.com/inbucket/inbucket) to capture emails sent from your local machine. This is useful for testing emails sent from Supabase Auth.

## Accessing Inbucket

By default, Inbucket is available at [localhost:54324](http://localhost:54324) when you run `supabase start`. Simply open this URL in your browser to view the emails.

## Going into Production

The "default" email provided by Supabase is only for development purposes. It is [heavily restricted](/docs/guides/platform/going-into-prod#auth-rate-limits) to ensure that it is not used for spam.

Before you go into production, you must configure your own email provider. This is as simple as enabling a new SMTP credentials in your [project settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/auth).
