You can debug your deployed Edge Functions using the ["Functions" section](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/functions) of the Dashboard. There are two debugging tools available:

- Invocations: shows the Request and Response for each execution.
- Logs: shows any platform events, including deployments and errors.

When [developing locally](/docs/guides/functions/local-development) you will see error messages and console log statements printed to your local terminal window.
