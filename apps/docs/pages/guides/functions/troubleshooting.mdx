## Unable to call Edge Function

If you're unable to call your Edge Function or are experiencing any CORS issues, even though you followed the [CORS guide](/docs/guides/functions/cors), please head over to [supabase.com/dashboard/project/\_/functions](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/functions), select your function from the list & click Logs. Do you see any errors listed there?

There are two debugging tools available: Invocations and Logs. Invocations shows the Request and Response for each execution, while Logs shows any platform events, including deployments and errors.

## Unable to deploy Edge Function

- Make sure you're on the latest version of the [Supabase CLI](/docs/guides/cli#updates).
- Run the deploy command with the `--debug` flag.
- Run the deploy command with the `--legacy-bundle` flag and see if that works.
- If the output from the commands above does not help you to resolve the issue, please open a support ticket via the Supabase Dashboard (by clicking the "Help" button at the top right) and include all output from the commands mentioned above.

## Edge Function takes too long to respond

- Head over to [supabase.com/dashboard/project/\_/functions](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/functions), select your function from the list & click Logs.
- In the looks, look for the `booted` event and check if they have consistent boot times.
  - If the boot times are similar, it's likely an issue with your function's code, like a large dependency etc.
  - If only some of the `booted` events are slow, please find the affected `region` in the metadata and submit a support request via the "Help" button at the top.

## Issues serving Edge Functions locally with the Supabase CLI

- Make sure you're on the latest version of the [Supabase CLI](/docs/guides/cli#updates).
- Run the serve command with the `--debug` flag.
- Support engineers can then try to run the provided sample code locally and see if they can reproduce the issue.
- Search the [Edge Runtime](https://github.com/supabase/edge-runtime) and [CLI](https://github.com/supabase/cli) repos for the error message, to see if it has been reported before.
- If the output from the commands above does not help you to resolve the issue, please open a support ticket via the Supabase Dashboard (by clicking the "Help" button at the top right) and include all output and details about your commands.
