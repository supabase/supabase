}

By default, Edge Functions are executed in the region closest to the user making the request. This helps to reduce network latency and provide faster responses to the user.

However, if your function does lot of database or storage operations, invoking the function in the same region as your DB may provide better performance.

Some situations where this might be helpful include:

- Bulk adding and editing records in your database
- Uploading files

If you prefer to do this, you can specify the region when invoking the function.

### How to set the region via HTTP headers

Use the `x-region` HTTP header when calling an Edge Function to determine where the Function should be executed.

```bash
curl --request POST 'https://<project_ref>.supabase.co/functions/v1/hello-world' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer ANON_KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'x-region: eu-west-3' \
  --data '{ "name":"Functions" }'
```

You can also specify the region using the [client libraries](/docs#reference-documentation), such as [supabase-js](/docs/reference/javascript/functions-invoke):

```js
// https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/installing
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

// Create a single supabase client for interacting with your database
const supabase = createClient('https://xyzcompany.supabase.co', 'public-anon-key')

const { data, error } = await supabase.functions.invoke('hello-world', {
  body: { name: 'Functions' },
  headers: { 'x-region': 'eu-west-3' },
})
```

You can verify the region the function was executed by looking at the `x-sb-edge-region` HTTP header in the response. You can also find it as metadata in [Edge Function Logs](/docs/guides/functions/debugging)

### Supported regions

These are the currently supported region values you can provide for `x-region` header.

- `ap-northeast-1`
- `ap-northeast-2`
- `ap-south-1`
- `ap-southeast-1`
- `ap-southeast-2`
- `ca-central-1`
- `eu-central-1`
- `eu-west-1`
- `eu-west-2`
- `eu-west-3`
- `sa-east-1`
- `us-east-1`
- `us-west-1`
- `us-west-2`

### What happens if the region has an outage?

If you explicitly specify the region via `x-region` header, the **request won't be automatically re-routed** to another region.
