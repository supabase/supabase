Developing with Edge Functions is similar to developing with Node.js, but with a few key differences. This guide will help you understand how to manage your dependencies.

## Importing dependencies

Supabase Edge Functions support:

- The Deno [standard library](https://deno.land/std)
- Third party [modules](https://deno.land/x)
- Node.js modules published to npm

We recommend using [esm.sh](https://esm.sh/) for importing modules that are published to npm. To do so, put `https://esm.sh/` in front of the package name. For example, import the `supabase-js` package like this:

```ts
import { createClient } from 'https://esm.sh/@supabase/supabase-js@2'
```

Full support for NPM is under development and coming soon.

## Importing Types

If your [environment is set up properly](/docs/guides/functions/local-development) and the module you're importing is exporting types, the import will have types and autocompletion support.

## Using Import Maps

An [Import Map](https://github.com/WICG/import-maps#the-import-map) is similar to a `package.json` file. They are a way to manage your dependencies. Consider this code:

```ts
// without import maps:
import lodash from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/lodash'

// with import maps:
import lodash from 'lodash'
```

You can accomplish this using an Import Map, which is a JSON file with the following:

```json supabase/functions/import_map.json
{
  "imports": {
    "lodash": "https://cdn.skypack.dev/lodash"
  }
}
```

We recommend creating one `import_map.json` within the `/supabase/functions` folder, similar to a `package.json` file, to define imports that can be used across all of your project's functions.

```bash
└── supabase
    ├── functions
    │   ├── import_map.json # A top-level import map to use across functions..
    │   ├── function-one
    │   │   └── index.ts
    └── config.toml
```

Alternatively, you can create one `import_map.json` file in each function folder, which will take priority over a top-level file.

You can override this default behavior by providing the `--import-map <string>` flag to the `serve` and `deploy` commands.

### Configuring VSCode

In order for vscode to understand the imports correctly, you need to specify the `deno.importMap` flag in your `.vscode/settings.json` file:

```json settings.json
{
  "deno.enable": true,
  "deno.unstable": true,
  "deno.importMap": "./supabase/functions/import_map.json"
}
```
