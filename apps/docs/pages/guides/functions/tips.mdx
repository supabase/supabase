## Database Functions vs Edge Functions

For data-intensive operations we recommend using [Database Functions](/docs/guides/database/functions), which are executed within your database
and can be called remotely using the [REST and GraphQL API](/docs/guides/api).

For use-cases which require low-latency we recommend [Edge Functions](/docs/guides/functions), which are globally-distributed and can be written in TypeScript.

## Organizing your Edge Functions

We recommend developing “fat functions”. This means that you should develop few large functions, rather than many small functions. One common pattern when developing Functions is that you need to share code between two or more Functions. To do this, you can store any shared code in a folder prefixed with an underscore (`_`). We recommend this folder structure:

```bash
└── supabase
    ├── functions
    │   ├── _shared
    │   |   ├── supabaseAdmin.ts # Supabase client with SERVICE_ROLE key
    │ 	│   └── supabaseClient.ts # Supabase client with ANON key
    │ 	├── function-one # use hyphens to name functions
    │ 	│   └── index.ts
    │ 	└── function-two
    │       └── index.ts
    ├── migrations
    └── config.toml
```

## Naming Edge Functions

We recommend using hyphens to name functions because hyphens are the most URL-friendly of all the naming conventions (snake_case, camelCase, PascalCase).

## Using HTTP Methods

Edge Functions supports `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, and `OPTIONS`. A function can be designed to perform different actions based on a request's HTTP method. See the [example on building a RESTful service](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/tree/master/examples/edge-functions/supabase/functions/restful-tasks) to learn how to handle different HTTP methods in your function.
