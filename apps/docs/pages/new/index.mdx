import Layout from '~/layouts/DefaultLayout'

export const meta = {
  title: 'Supabase Docs',
}

In this 25-minute guide, weâ€™ll be building a collaborative user managment app using NextJS and Supabase.
As users add and move rectangles in a canvas, changes will be automatically synced and persisted, allowing for a canvas that updates in real-time across clients.
Users will also be able to see other users selections, and undo and redo actions.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta} children={children} />
