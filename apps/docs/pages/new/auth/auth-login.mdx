## Learn how to use Supabase Auth to handle authentication and authorization of your users blah blah i am test text

Auth0 Universal Login defines your login flow, which is the key feature of an Authorization Server.
Each time a user needs to prove their identity, your applications redirect to Universal Login and Auth0 will do what is needed to guarantee the user's identity.

By choosing Universal Login, you don't have to do any integration work to handle the various flavors of authentication. You can start off using a simple username and password.
You can also add other features such as social login and multi-factor authentication (MFA). All of this is dynamic and adjustable in real-time without requiring application-level changes because all functionality is driven by the web pages served by the centralized Authentication Server.
Your application will benefit from any improvements Auth0 makes in the login flow without the need for you to change your code.

Create a consistent, branded login experience by customizing the login page appearance and behavior from the Auth0 Dashboard including the logo and colors.
For more advanced use cases, you can change the code of each page.
