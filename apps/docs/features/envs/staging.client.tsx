 * Preview builds don't need to be statically generated to optimize performance.
 * This (somewhat hacky) way of shortcutting preview builds cuts their build
 * time and speeds up the feedback loop for previewing docs changes in Vercel.
 *
 * This technically breaks the Rules of Hooks to avoid an unnecessary full-app
 * rerender in prod, but this is fine because IS_PREVIEW will never change on
 * you within a single build.
