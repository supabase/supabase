# Contributing to Supabase Docs

Thanks for contributing to Supabase Docs! Here are a few resources to help you get started.

The code and content for our docs site are located in the main [Supabase GitHub repo](https://github.com/supabase/supabase), under the `apps/docs` directory.

In the repo, you'll also find:

- The [developers guide](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/master/apps/docs/DEVELOPERS.md), which will help you set up your local machine to develop the docs site
- The [contributing guide](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/master/apps/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md), which goes over the content organization and some general guidelines for writing docs content

## Components

Our docs content is mainly written in MDX. Aside from standard GitHub-flavored Markdown, you can use the following helper components to help you organize and display your content:

### Accordion

For content that requires progressive disclosure:

```mdx
<Accordion
  type="default"
  openBehaviour="multiple"
  chevronAlign="right"
  justified
  size="medium"
  className="text-foreground-light mt-8 mb-6"
>
  <div className="border-b mt-3 pb-3">
    <AccordionItem
      header="Accordion item 1"
      id="item-1"
    >

    Your content here.

    </AccordionItem>

  </div>
  <div className="border-b mt-3 pb-3">
    <AccordionItem
      header="Accordion item 2"
      id="item-2"
    >

    More content here.

    </AccordionItem>

  </div>
</Accordion>
```

<Accordion
  type="default"
  openBehaviour="multiple"
  chevronAlign="right"
  justified
  size="medium"
  className="text-foreground-light mt-8 mb-6"
>
  <div className="border-b mt-3 pb-3">
    <AccordionItem
      header="Accordion item 1"
      id="item-1"
    >

    Your content here.

    </AccordionItem>

  </div>
  <div className="border-b mt-3 pb-3">
    <AccordionItem
      header="Accordion item 2"
      id="item-2"
    >

    More content here.

    </AccordionItem>

  </div>
</Accordion>

### Admonition

For extra information that doesn't fit into the main flow. There are 5 supported types of admonitions:

- `danger` to warn the user about any missteps that could cause data loss or data leaks
- `deprecation` to notify the user about features that are (or will soon be) deprecated
- `caution` to warn about anything that could cause a bug or serious user inconvenience
- `tip` to point out helpful but optional actions
- `note` for anything else

Leave a blank line between the admonition tag and the contained content. This will prevent Prettier from trying to break the lines within the content.

```mdx
<Admonition type="danger">

This could lead to data loss!

</Admonition>

<Admonition type="deprecation">

This feature is deprecated.

</Admonition>

<Admonition type="caution">

You should make sure you don't set this up wrong.

</Admonition>

<Admonition type="tip">

In certain cases, you may want to do this.

</Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">

Additional helpful information.

</Admonition>
```

<Admonition type="danger">

This could lead to data loss!

</Admonition>

<Admonition type="deprecation">

</Admonition>

<Admonition type="caution">

</Admonition>

<Admonition type="tip">

</Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">

Additional helpful information.

</Admonition>

### Icons

The following icons are available. They can be styled with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) classes:

```mdx
<IconArrowDown />
<IconCheck />
<IconX />
```

<div class="flex items-center gap-2">
  <IconArrowDown />
  <IconCheck />
  <IconX />
</div>

### Image

You can include images with regular Markdown syntax:

```mdx
![Supabase architectural diagram](/docs/img/supabase-architecture.svg)
```

![Supabase architectural diagram](/docs/img/supabase-architecture.svg)

If your image has alternate light and dark versions, or you want to make it zoomable, you can also use the image component:

```mdx
<Image
  alt="Supabase architectural diagram"
  src={{
    dark: '/docs/img/supabase-architecture.svg',
    light: '/docs/img/supabase-architecture--light.svg',
  }}
  zoomable
/>
```

<Image
  alt="Supabase architectural diagram"
  src={{
    dark: '/docs/img/supabase-architecture.svg',
    light: '/docs/img/supabase-architecture--light.svg',
  }}
  zoomable
/>

### Project Variables

Some guides and tutorials will require that users copy their Supabase project URL and anon key. You can provide those inline if the user is signed in:

```mdx
<ProjectConfigVariables variable="url" />
<ProjectConfigVariables variable="anonKey" />
```

<ProjectConfigVariables variable="url" />
<ProjectConfigVariables variable="anonKey" />

### Step Hike

For tutorials, which feature step-by-step instructions, often with accompanying code, we use the `StepHike` pattern:

````mdx
<StepHikeCompact>

  <StepHikeCompact.Step step={1}>

    <StepHikeCompact.Details title="The first step">

    Explanation of what to do first.

    </StepHikeCompact.Details>

    <StepHikeCompact.Code>

      ```sql
      select ...
      ```

    </StepHikeCompact.Code>

  </StepHikeCompact.Step>

  <StepHikeCompact.Step step={2}>

    <StepHikeCompact.Details title="No code in this step" fullWidth>

    Explanation of what to do next. This stretches the full width of the section: Sweet tiramisu apple biscuit candy cake. Orange ipsum muffin cookie cake biscuit. Orange muffin vanilla sweet sugar candy. Sprinkles jelly sweet orange candy cream.

    </StepHikeCompact.Details>

  </StepHikeCompact.Step>

</StepHikeCompact>
````

<StepHikeCompact>

  <StepHikeCompact.Step step={1}>

    <StepHikeCompact.Details title="The first step">

    Explanation of what to do first.

    </StepHikeCompact.Details>

    <StepHikeCompact.Code>

      ```sql
      select ...
      ```

    </StepHikeCompact.Code>

  </StepHikeCompact.Step>

  <StepHikeCompact.Step step={2}>

    <StepHikeCompact.Details title="No code in this step" fullWidth>

    Explanation of what to do next. This stretches the full width of the section: Sweet tiramisu apple biscuit candy cake. Orange ipsum muffin cookie cake biscuit. Orange muffin vanilla sweet sugar candy. Sprinkles jelly sweet orange candy cream.


    </StepHikeCompact.Details>

  </StepHikeCompact.Step>

</StepHikeCompact>

### Tabs

Use tabs when users can select between multiple versions of the content. For example, the content might differ based on language or package manager.

If you include the `queryGroup` prop, the user's selection will sync with other tab groups. Leave out this prop to omit this behavior.

````mdx
<Tabs
  scrollable
  size="small"
  type="underlined"
  defaultActiveId="js"
  queryGroup="language"
>
<TabPanel id="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
const supabase = createSupabaseClient()
```

</TabPanel>
<TabPanel id="dart" label="Dart">

```dart
void main() async {
  Supabase.initialize();
}
```

</TabPanel>
</Tabs>
````

<Tabs
  scrollable
  size="small"
  type="underlined"
  defaultActiveId="js"
  queryGroup="language"
>
<TabPanel id="js" label="JavaScript">

```js
const supabase = createSupabaseClient()
```

</TabPanel>
<TabPanel id="dart" label="Dart">

```dart
void main() async {
  Supabase.initialize();
}
```

</TabPanel>
</Tabs>

## Partials

We incorporate content reuse in the docs to avoid duplication. If you find yourself writing the same content over and over, you can put it in a partial instead. Here are some examples of commonly used partials:

<Accordion
  type="default"
  openBehaviour="multiple"
  chevronAlign="right"
  justified
  size="medium"
  className="text-foreground-light mt-8 mb-6"
>
  <div className="border-b mt-3 pb-3">
    <AccordionItem
      header="Database setup"
      id="database-setup"
    >

    ```mdx
    <DatabaseSetup />
    ```

    <DatabaseSetup />

    </AccordionItem>

  </div>
  <div className="border-b mt-3 pb-3">
    <AccordionItem
      header="Create client for Auth"
      id="create-client-auth"
    >

    ```mdx
    <CreateClientSnippet />
    ```

    <CreateClientSnippet />

    </AccordionItem>

  </div>
</Accordion>

To make a new partial:

1. Make a new MDX file in `apps/docs/components/MDX`.
1. Write your reusable content.
1. Inside `apps/docs/components/MDX/partials.tsx`, import and re-export your partial.
1. Inside `apps/docs/features/docs/mdx.shared.tsx`, import your partial and include it in the `components` object.
1. You can now use your partial inside any other MDX file by using: `<YourPartialName />`.
