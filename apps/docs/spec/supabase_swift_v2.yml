    title: "Initializing"
    description: |
      You can initialize Supabase with the `SupabaseClient` by passing your `Project URL` and `Project Key`. You can find these under your `Project Settings` → `API Settings`
      The Supabase client is your entrypoint to the rest of the Supabase functionality and is the easiest way to interact with everything we offer within the Supabase ecosystem.

    examples:
      - id: initialize-client
        name: Initialize Client
        code: |
          ```swift
          let client = SupabaseClient(supabaseURL: URL(string: "https://xyzcompany.supabase.co")!, supabaseKey: "public-anon-key")
          ```
      - id: initialize-client-custom-options
        name: Initialize Client with custom options
        code: |
          ```swift
          let client = SupabaseClient(
            supabaseURL: URL(string: "https://xyzcompany.supabase.co")!, 
            supabaseKey: "public-anon-key",
            options: SupabaseClientOptions(
              db: .init(
                schema: "public"
              ),
              auth: .init(
                storage: MyCustomLocalStorage(),
                flowType: .pkce
              ),
              global: .init(
                headers: ["x-my-custom-header": "my-app-name"],
                session: URLSession.myCustomSession
              )

          ```
  - id: sign-up
    title: "signUp()"
    notes: |
      - By default, the user needs to verify their email address before logging in. To turn this off, disable **Confirm email** in [your project](/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers).
      - **Confirm email** determines if users need to confirm their email address after signing up.
        - If **Confirm email** is enabled, a `user` is returned but `session` is null.
        - If **Confirm email** is disabled, both a `user` and a `session` are returned.
      - When the user confirms their email address, they are redirected to the [`SITE_URL`](/docs/guides/auth/concepts/redirect-urls) by default. You can modify your `SITE_URL` or add additional redirect URLs in [your project](/dashboard/project/_/auth/url-configuration).
      - If signUp() is called for an existing confirmed user:
        - When both **Confirm email** and **Confirm phone** (even when phone provider is disabled) are enabled in [your project](/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers), an obfuscated/fake user object is returned.
        - When either **Confirm email** or **Confirm phone** (even when phone provider is disabled) is disabled, the error message, `User already registered` is returned.
      - To fetch the currently logged-in user, refer to [`getUser()`](/docs/reference/swift/get-user).

        description: |
          The user will be sent a WhatsApp message which contains a OTP. By default, a given user can only request a OTP once every 60 seconds. Note that a user will need to have a valid WhatsApp account that is linked to Twilio in order to use this feature.
        code: |
          ```swift
          try await supabase.auth.signUp(

          - You can provide a default redirect URL when initializing the client.
          - See [redirect URLs and wildcards](/docs/guides/auth/overview#redirect-urls-and-wildcards) to add additional redirect URLs to your project.
        code: |
          ```swift
          try await supabase.auth.signUp(
            email:  "example@email.com",
            password: "example-password",
            redirectTo: URL(string: "https://example.com/welcome")!
          )
          ```
  - id: on-auth-state-change
    title: "onAuthStateChange()"
    notes: |
      - Subscribes to important events occurring on the user's session.
      - Emitted events:
        - `INITIAL_SESSION`
          - Emitted right after the Supabase client is constructed and the initial session from storage is loaded.
        - `SIGNED_IN`
          - Emitted each time a user session is confirmed or re-established, including on user sign in. 
          - Avoid making assumptions as to when this event is fired, this may occur even when the user is already signed in. Instead, check the user object attached to the event to see if a new user has signed in and update your application's UI.
        - `SIGNED_OUT`
          - Emitted when the user signs out. This can be after:
            - A call to `supabase.auth.signOut()`.
            - After the user's session has expired for any reason:
              - User has signed out on another device.
              - The session has reached its timebox limit or inactivity timeout.
              - User has signed in on another device with single session per user enabled.
              - Check the [User Sessions](/docs/guides/auth/sessions) docs for more information.
          - Use this to clean up any local storage your application has associated with the user.
        - `TOKEN_REFRESHED`
          - Emitted each time a new access and refresh token are fetched for the signed in user.
          - It's best practice and highly recommended to extract the access token (JWT) and store it in memory for further use in your application.
            - Avoid frequent calls to `supabase.auth.session` for the same purpose.
          - There is a background process that keeps track of when the session should be refreshed so you will always receive valid tokens by listening to this event.
          - The frequency of this event is related to the JWT expiry limit configured on your project.
        - `USER_UPDATED`
          - Emitted each time the `supabase.auth.update(user:)` method finishes successfully. Listen to it to update your application's UI based on new profile information.
        - `PASSWORD_RECOVERY`
          - Emitted instead of the `SIGNED_IN` event when the user lands on a page that includes a password recovery link in the URL.
          - Use it to show a UI to the user where they can [reset their password](/docs/guides/auth/passwords#resetting-a-users-password-forgot-password).

    examples:
      - id: listen-to-auth-changes
        name: Listen to auth changes

        code: |
          ```swift

          // Using AsyncStream
          for await (event, session) in await supabase.auth.authStateChanges {
            print(event, session)
          }

          // Using Closure
          let subscription = await supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange { event, session in 
            print(event, session)
          }

          // call remove() to remove subscription
          subscription.remove()
          ```
        description: |
          - When using closure based, remember to call `remove()` on the returned subscription.
          - When using AsyncStream, it automatically removes the subscription when AsyncStream is canceled, or finishes.

  - id: sign-in-anonymously
    title: "signInAnonymously()"
    notes: |
      - Returns an anonymous user
      - It is recommended to set up captcha for anonymous sign-ins to prevent abuse. You can pass in the captcha token in the `options` param.

            type: .sms
          )
          ```
  - id: sign-in-with-otp
    title: "signInWithOTP()"
    notes: |
      - Requires either an email or phone number.
      - This method is used for passwordless sign-ins where a OTP is sent to the user's email or phone number.
      - If the user doesn't exist, `signInWithOTP()` will signup the user instead. To restrict this behavior, you can set `shouldCreateUser` to `false``.
      - If you're using an email, you can configure whether you want the user to receive a magiclink or a OTP.
      - If you're using phone, you can configure whether you want the user to receive a OTP.
      - The magic link's destination URL is determined by the [`SITE_URL`](/docs/guides/auth/concepts/redirect-urls).
      - See [redirect URLs and wildcards](/docs/guides/auth#redirect-urls-and-wildcards) to add additional redirect URLs to your project.
      - Magic links and OTPs share the same implementation. To send users a one-time code instead of a magic link, [modify the magic link email template](/dashboard/project/_/auth/templates) to include `{{ .Token }}` instead of `{{ .ConfirmationURL }}`.
      - See our [Twilio Phone Auth Guide](/docs/guides/auth/phone-login/twilio) for details about configuring WhatsApp sign in.

          - getOAuthSignInURL() provides the URL which needs to be opened preferably in a [ASWebAuthenticationSession](ASWebAuthenticationSession) instance..
          - The redirectTo URL, or `callbackURLScheme` needs to be setup correctly in your project under Authentication -> URL Configuration -> Redirect URLs.
          - When using `ASWebAuthenticationSession` or any other implementation, use the returning URL as input to `session(from:)` method.
        code: |

          If you need additional data from an OAuth provider, you can include a space-separated list of scopes in your request to get back an OAuth provider token.
          You may also need to specify the scopes in the provider's OAuth app settings, depending on the provider. The list of scopes will be documented by the third-party provider you are using and specifying scopes will enable you to use the OAuth provider token to call additional APIs supported by the third-party provider to get more information.
        code: |

  - id: sign-in-with-sso
    title: 'signInWithSSO()'
    notes: |
      - Before you can call this method you need to [establish a connection](/docs/guides/auth/sso/auth-sso-saml#managing-saml-20-connections) to an identity provider. Use the [CLI commands](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-sso) to do this.
      - If you've associated an email domain to the identity provider, you can use the `domain` property to start a sign-in flow.
      - In case you need to use a different way to start the authentication flow with an identity provider, you can use the `providerId` property. For example:
          - Mapping specific user email addresses with an identity provider.
          - Using different hints to identity the identity provider to be used by the user, like a company-specific page, IP address or other tracking information.
    examples:
      - id: sign-in-with-domain

  - id: verify-otp
    title: "verifyOTP()"
    notes: |
      - The `verifyOTP` method takes in different verification types. If a phone number is used, the type can either be `sms` or `phone_change`. If an email address is used, the type can be one of the following: `signup`, `magiclink`, `recovery`, `invite`, `email_change`, or `email`.
      - The verification type used should be determined based on the corresponding auth method called before `verifyOTP` to sign up / sign-in a user.

    title: "user()"
    description: |
      - This method is useful for checking if the user is authorized because it validates the user's access token JWT on the server.
      - Fetches the user object from the database instead of local session.
      - Should be used only when you require the most current user data. For faster results, `session.user` is recommended.

    notes: |
      - The **Enable Manual Linking** option must be enabled from your [project's authentication settings](/dashboard/project/_/settings/auth).
      - The user needs to be signed in to call `unlinkIdentity()`.
      - The user must have at least 2 identities in order to unlink an identity.
      - The identity to be unlinked must belong to the user.
    examples:
      - id: unlink-identity

  - id: send-password-reauthentication
    title: "reauthenticate()"
    notes: |
      - This method is used together with `update(user:)` when a user's password needs to be updated.
      - If you require your user to reauthenticate before updating their password, you need to enable the **Secure password change** option in your [project's email provider settings](/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers).
      - A user is only require to reauthenticate before updating their password if **Secure password change** is enabled and the user **hasn't recently signed in**. A user is deemed recently signed in if the session was created in the last 24 hours.
      - This method will send a nonce to the user's email. If the user doesn't have a confirmed email address, the method will send the nonce to the user's confirmed phone number instead.
    examples:
      - id: send-reauthentication-nonce
        name: Send reauthentication nonce
        description: Sends a reauthentication nonce to the user's email or phone number.

    notes: |
      - Resends a signup confirmation, email change, or phone change email to the user.
      - Passwordless sign-ins can be resent by calling the `signInWithOTP()` method again.
      - Password recovery emails can be resent by calling the `resetPasswordForEmail()` method again.
      - This method only resends an email or phone OTP to the user if there an initial signup, email change, or phone change request was made.
      - You can specify a redirect URL when you resend an email link using the `emailRedirectTo` option.
    examples:
      - id: resend-email-signup-confirmation

  - id: set-session
    title: "setSession()"
    notes: |
      - `setSession()` takes in a refresh token and uses it to get a new session.
      - The refresh token can only be used once to obtain a new session.
      - [Refresh token rotation](/docs/reference/auth/config#refresh_token_rotation_enabled) is enabled by default on all projects to guard against replay attacks.
      - You can configure the [`REFRESH_TOKEN_REUSE_INTERVAL`](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/auth/config#refresh_token_reuse_interval) which provides a short window in which the same refresh token can be used multiple times in the event of concurrency or offline issues.

  - id: auth-mfa-api
    title: "Overview"
    notes: |
      This section contains methods commonly used for Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and are invoked behind the `supabase.auth.mfa` namespace.

      Currently, we only support time-based one-time password (TOTP) as the 2nd factor. We don't support recovery codes but we allow users to enroll more than 1 TOTP factor, with an upper limit of 10.

      Having a 2nd TOTP factor for recovery frees the user of the burden of having to store their recovery codes somewhere. It also reduces the attack surface since multiple recovery codes are usually generated compared to just having 1 backup TOTP factor.
  - id: mfa-enroll
    title: "mfa.enroll()"
    notes: |
      - Currently, `totp` is the only supported `factorType`. The returned `id` should be used to create a challenge.
      - To create a challenge, see [`mfa.challenge()`](/docs/reference/swift/auth-mfa-challenge).
      - To verify a challenge, see [`mfa.verify()`](/docs/reference/swift/auth-mfa-verify).
      - To create and verify a challenge in a single step, see [`mfa.challengeAndVerify()`](/docs/reference/swift/auth-mfa-challengeandverify).

  - id: mfa-get-authenticator-assurance-level
    title: "mfa.getAuthenticatorAssuranceLevel()"
    notes: |
      - Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL) is the measure of the strength of an authentication mechanism.
      - In Supabase, having an AAL of `aal1` refers to having the 1st factor of authentication such as an email and password or OAuth sign-in while `aal2` refers to the 2nd factor of authentication such as a time-based, one-time-password (TOTP).
      - If the user has a verified factor, the `nextLevel` field will return `aal2`, else, it will return `aal1`.
    examples:
      - id: get-aal
        name: Get the AAL details of a session
        isSpotlight: true
        code: |

  - id: admin-api
    title: 'Overview'
    notes: |
      - Any method under the `supabase.auth.admin` namespace requires a `service_role` key.
      - These methods are considered admin methods and should be called on a trusted server. Never expose your `service_role` key in the browser.
    examples:
      - id: create-auth-admin-client
        name: Create server-side auth client
        isSpotlight: true
        code: |
          ```swift
          import Supabase

          let supabase = SupabaseClient(
            supabaseURL: supabaseURL,
            supabaseKey: serviceRoleKey
          )

          // Access auth admin api
          let adminAuthClient = supabase.auth.admin
          ```
  - id: delete-user
    title: 'deleteUser()'
    notes: |
      - The `deleteUser()` method requires the user's ID, which maps to the `auth.users.id` column.
    examples:
      - id: removes-a-user
        name: Removes a user
        isSpotlight: true
        code: |
          ```swift
          try await supabase.auth.admin.deleteUser(
            id: "715ed5db-f090-4b8c-a067-640ecee36aa0"
          )
          ```
  - id: select
    title: "Fetch data: select()"
    notes: |
      - By default, Supabase projects will return a maximum of 1,000 rows. This setting can be changed in Project API Settings. It's recommended that you keep it low to limit the payload size of accidental or malicious requests. You can use `range()` queries to paginate through your data.
      - `select()` can be combined with [Modifiers](/docs/reference/swift/using-modifiers)
      - `select()` can be combined with [Filters](/docs/reference/swift/using-filters)
      - If using the Supabase hosted platform `apikey` is technically a reserved keyword, since the API gateway will pluck it out for authentication. [It should be avoided as a column name](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/issues/5465).
      - The recommended solution for getting data is to use the value property which will return a decoded model. Create a `Codable` to easily decode your database responses.

    title: "Modify data: update()"
    notes: |
      - `update()` should always be combined with [Filters](/docs/reference/swift/using-filters) to target the item(s) you wish to update.
    examples:
      - id: updating-your-data

        notes: |
          Not always you need to create a `Encodable`` struct to define

        description: |
          In the following query, `upsert()` implicitly uses the `id`
          (primary key) column to determine conflicts. If there is no existing
          row with the same `id`, `upsert()` inserts a new row, which
          will fail in this case as there is already a row with `handle` `"saoirse"`.
          Using the `onConflict` option, you can instruct `upsert()` to use
          another column with a unique constraint to determine conflicts.

    title: "Delete data: delete()"

    notes: |
      - `delete()` should always be combined with [filters](/docs/reference/swift/using-filters) to target the item(s) you wish to delete.
      - If you use `delete()` with filters and you have
        [RLS](/docs/learn/auth-deep-dive/auth-row-level-security) enabled, only
        rows visible through `SELECT` policies are deleted. Note that by default
        no rows are visible, so you need at least one `SELECT`/`ALL` policy that
        makes the rows visible.

    title: Using Filters
    description: |
      Filters allow you to only return rows that match certain conditions.

      Filters can be used on `select()`, `update()`, `upsert()`, and `delete()` queries.

      If a Postgres function returns a table response, you can also apply filters.

      Implement `URLQueryRepresentable` protocol in your own types to be able to use them as filter value.

      Supported filtes are: `eq`, `neq`, `gt`, `gte`, `lt`, `lte`, `like`, `ilike`, `is`, `in`, `cs`, `cd`, `sl`, `sr`, `nxl`, `nxr`, `adj`, `ov`, `fts`, `plfts`, `phfts`, `wfts`. Check available operators in [PostgREST](https://postgrest.org/en/stable/references/api/tables_views.html#operators).
    examples:
      - id: applying-filters
        name: Applying Filters
        description: |
          Filters must be applied after any of `select()`, `update()`, `upsert()`,
          `delete()`, and `rpc()` and before
          [modifiers](/docs/reference/swift/using-modifiers).

            .eq("name", value: "The Shire")    // Correct

          try await supabase.database
            .from("citites")

          ```swift

        .not("name", operator: .eq, value: "Paris")
        .not("arraycol", operator: .cs, value: #"{"a","b"}"#) // Use Postgres array {} for array column and 'cs' for contains.
        .not("rangecol", operator: .cs, value: "(1,2]") // Use Postgres range syntax for range column.
        .not("id", operator: .in, value: "(6,7)")  // Use Postgres list () and 'in' for in_ filter.
        .not("id", operator: .in, value: "(\(mylist.join(separator: ",")))")  // You can insert a Swift list array.

    title: Using Modifiers
    description: |
      Filters work on the row level—they allow you to return rows that
      only match certain conditions without changing the shape of the rows.
      Modifiers are everything that don't fit that definition—allowing you to
      change the format of the response (e.g. returning a CSV string).

      Modifiers must be specified after filters. Some modifiers only apply for
      queries that return rows (e.g., `select()` or `rpc()` on a function that
      returns a table response).

      Invoke a Supabase Edge Function.
    notes: |
      - Requires an Authorization header.
      - When you pass in a body to your function, we automatically attach the Content-Type header for `String`, and `Data`. If it doesn't match any of these types we assume the payload is `json`, serialize it and attach the `Content-Type` header as `application/json`. You can override this behaviour by passing in a `Content-Type` header of your own.

      - By default, Broadcast and Presence are enabled for all projects.
      - By default, listening to database changes is disabled for new projects due to database performance and security concerns. You can turn it on by managing Realtime's [replication](/docs/guides/api#realtime-api-overview).
      - You can receive the "previous" data for updates and deletes by setting the table's `REPLICA IDENTITY` to `FULL` (e.g., `ALTER TABLE your_table REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;`).
      - Row level security is not applied to delete statements. When RLS is enabled and replica identity is set to full, only the primary key is sent to clients.

    notes: |
      - Removing a channel is a great way to maintain the performance of your project's Realtime service as well as your database if you're listening to Postgres changes.
      - Supabase will automatically handle cleanup 30 seconds after a client is disconnected, but unused channels may cause degradation as more clients are simultaneously subscribed.
      - If you removed all channels, the client automatically disconnects from the Realtime websocket. This can be disabled in the Realtime config by setting `disconnectOnNoSubscriptions` to false.
