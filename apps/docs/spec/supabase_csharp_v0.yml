    title: Initializing
    description: |
      Initializing a new client is pretty straightforward. Find your project url and public key from the
      admin panel and pass it into your client initialization function.

      `supabase-csharp` is heavily dependent on Models deriving from `BaseModel`. To interact with the API, one must have the associated model (see example) specified.

      Leverage `Table`, `PrimaryKey`, and `Column` attributes to specify names of classes/properties that are different from their C# Versions.

    examples:
      - id: csharp-init-standard
        name: Standard
        code: |
          ```c#
          var url = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("SUPABASE_URL");
          var key = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("SUPABASE_KEY");

          var options = new Supabase.SupabaseOptions
          {
              AutoConnectRealtime = true
          };

          var supabase = new Supabase.Client(url, key, options);
          await supabase.InitializeAsync();
          ```
      - id: csharp-init-maui
        name: Dependency Injection (Maui-like)
        code: |
          ```c#
          public static MauiApp CreateMauiApp()
          {
                // ...
                var builder = MauiApp.CreateBuilder();

                var url = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("SUPABASE_URL");
                var key = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("SUPABASE_KEY");
                var options = new SupabaseOptions
                {
                  AutoRefreshToken = true,
                  AutoConnectRealtime = true,
                  // SessionHandler = new SupabaseSessionHandler() <-- This must be implemented by the developer
                };

                // Note the creation as a singleton.
                builder.Services.AddSingleton(provider => new Supabase.Client(url, key, options));
          }
          ```
      - id: csharp-init-showing-models
        name: With Models Example
        code: |
          ```c#
          // Given the following Model representing the Supabase Database (Message.cs)
          [Table("messages")]
          public class Message : BaseModel
          {
              [PrimaryKey("id")]
              public int Id { get; set; }

              [Column("username")]
              public string UserName { get; set; }

              [Column("channel_id")]
              public int ChannelId { get; set; }

              public override bool Equals(object obj)
              {
                  return obj is Message message &&
                          Id == message.Id;
              }

              public override int GetHashCode()
              {
                  return HashCode.Combine(Id);
              }
          }

          void Initialize()
          {
              // Get All Messages
              var response = await client.Table<Message>().Get();
              List<Message> models = response.Models;

              // Insert
              var newMessage = new Message { UserName = "acupofjose", ChannelId = 1 };
              await client.Table<Message>().Insert();

              // Update
              var model = response.Models.First();
              model.UserName = "elrhomariyounes";
              await model.Update();

              // Delete
              await response.Models.Last().Delete();

              // etc.
          }
          ```
  - id: sign-up
    title: 'SignUp()'
    description: |
      Creates a new user.
    notes: |
      - By default, the user needs to verify their email address before logging in. To turn this off, disable **Confirm email** in [your project](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers).
      - **Confirm email** determines if users need to confirm their email address after signing up.
        - If **Confirm email** is enabled, a `user` is returned but `session` is null.
        - If **Confirm email** is disabled, both a `user` and a `session` are returned.
      - When the user confirms their email address, they are redirected to the [`SITE_URL`](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/concepts/redirect-urls) by default. You can modify your `SITE_URL` or add additional redirect URLs in [your project](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/url-configuration).
      - If SignUp() is called for an existing confirmed user:
        - When both **Confirm email** and **Confirm phone** (even when phone provider is disabled) are enabled in [your project](/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers), an obfuscated/fake user object is returned.
        - When either **Confirm email** or **Confirm phone** (even when phone provider is disabled) is disabled, the error message, `User already registered` is returned.
    examples:
      - id: sign-up
        name: Sign up.
        isSpotlight: true
        code: |
          ```c#
          var session = await supabase.Auth.SignUp(email, password);
          ```
  - id: sign-in-with-password
    title: 'SignIn(email, password)'
    description: |
      Log in an existing user using email or phone number with password.
    notes: |
      - Requires either an email and password or a phone number and password.
    examples:
      - id: sign-in-with-email-and-password
        name: Sign in with email and password
        isSpotlight: true
        code: |
          ```c#

          ```
      - id: sign-in-with-phone-and-password
        name: Sign in with phone and password
        code: |
          ```c#
          var session = await supabase.Auth.SignIn(SignInType.Phone, phoneNumber, password);
          ```
  - id: sign-in-with-otp
    title: 'SendMagicLink() and SignIn(SignInType, Phone)'
    notes: |
      - Requires either an email or phone number.
      - This method is used for passwordless sign-ins where a OTP is sent to the user's email or phone number.
      - If you're using an email, you can configure whether you want the user to receive a magiclink or a OTP.
      - If you're using phone, you can configure whether you want the user to receive a OTP.
      - The magic link's destination URL is determined by the [`SITE_URL`](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/concepts/redirect-urls). You can modify the `SITE_URL` or add additional redirect urls in [your project](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/settings).
    examples:
      - id: sign-in-with-email
        name: Send Magic Link.
        isSpotlight: true
        description: |
          The user will be sent an email which contains either a magiclink or a OTP or both. By default, a given user can only request a OTP once every 60 seconds.
          You can pass `emailRedirectTo` with dynamic link to bring the users back to your app after they click on the magic link.
        code: |
          ```c#
          var options = new SignInOptions { RedirectTo = "http://myredirect.example" };
          var didSendMagicLink = await supabase.Auth.SendMagicLink("joseph@supabase.io", options);
          ```
      - id: sign-in-with-sms-otp
        name: Sign in with SMS OTP.
        description: The user will be sent a SMS which contains a OTP. By default, a given user can only request a OTP once every 60 seconds.
        code: |
          ```c#
          await supabase.Auth.SignIn(SignInType.Phone, "+13334445555");

          // Paired with `VerifyOTP` to get a session
          var session = await supabase.Auth.VerifyOTP("+13334445555", TOKEN, MobileOtpType.SMS);
          ```
  - id: sign-in-with-oauth
    title: 'SignIn(Provider)'
    description: |
      Signs the user in using third party OAuth providers.
    notes: |
      - This method is used for signing in using a third-party provider.
      - Supabase supports many different [third-party providers](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth#providers).
    examples:
      - id: sign-in-using-a-third-party-provider
        name: Sign in using a third-party provider
        isSpotlight: true
        code: |
          ```c#
          var signInUrl = supabase.Auth.SignIn(Provider.Github);
          ```
      - id: sign-in-with-scopes
        name: With scopes
        description: |
          If you need additional data from an OAuth provider, you can include a space-separated list of scopes in your request to get back an OAuth provider token.
          You may also need to specify the scopes in the provider's OAuth app settings, depending on the provider.
        code: |
          ```c#
          var signInUrl = supabase.Auth.SignIn(Provider.Github, 'repo gist notifications');

          // after user comes back from signin flow
          var session = supabase.Auth.GetSessionFromUrl(REDIRECTED_URI);
          ```
  - id: sign-out
    title: 'SignOut()'
    description: |
      Signs out the current user, if there is a logged in user.
    notes: |
      - In order to use the `SignOut()` method, the user needs to be signed in first.
    examples:
      - id: sign-out
        name: Sign out
        isSpotlight: true
        code: |
          ```c#
          await supabase.Auth.SignOut();
          ```
  - id: verify-otp
    title: 'VerifyOtp()'
    notes: |
      - The `VerifyOtp` method takes in different verification types. If a phone number is used, the type can either be `sms` or `phone_change`. If an email address is used, the type can be one of the following: `signup`, `magiclink`, `recovery`, `invite` or `email_change`.
      - The verification type used should be determined based on the corresponding auth method called before `VerifyOtp` to sign up / sign-in a user.
    examples:
      - id: verify-sms-one-time-password(otp)
        name: Verify Sms One-Time Password (OTP)
        isSpotlight: true
        code: |
          ```c#
          var session = await supabase.Auth.VerifyOTP("+13334445555", TOKEN, MobileOtpType.SMS);
          ```
  - id: get-session
    title: 'CurrentSession'

    examples:
      - id: get-the-session-data
        name: Get the session data
        isSpotlight: true
        code: |
          ```c#
          var session = supabase.Auth.CurrentSession;
          ```
  - id: get-user
    title: 'CurrentUser'
    description: |
      Returns the user data, if there is a logged in user.
    examples:
      - name: Get the logged in user
        isSpotlight: true
        code: |
          ```c#
          var user = supabase.Auth.CurrentUser;
          ```
  - id: update-user
    title: 'UpdateUser()'
    description: |
      Updates user data, if there is a logged in user.
    notes: |
      - In order to use the `UpdateUser()` method, the user needs to be signed in first.
      - By Default, email updates sends a confirmation link to both the user's current and new email.
      To only send a confirmation link to the user's new email, disable **Secure email change** in your project's [email auth provider settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/settings).
    examples:
      - id: update-the-email-for-an-authenticated-user
        name: Update the email for an authenticated user
        description: Sends a "Confirm Email Change" email to the new email address.

          var attrs = new UserAttributes
          {
            Data = new Dictionary<string, string> { {"example", "data" } }
          };
          var response = await supabase.Auth.Update(attrs);
          ```
  - id: on-auth-state-change
    title: 'StateChanged'
    description: |

    notes: |
      - Types of auth events: `AuthState.SignedIn`, `AuthState.SignedOut`, `AuthState.UserUpdated`, `AuthState.PasswordRecovery`, `AuthState.TokenRefreshed`
    examples:

  - id: auth-reset-password-for-email
    title: 'ResetPasswordForEmail()'
    description: |
      Sends a reset request to an email address.
    notes: |
      Sends a password reset request to an email address. When the user clicks the reset link in the email they are redirected back to your application. Prompt the user for a new password and call Auth.UpdateUser():

    examples:
      - id: reset-password
        name: Reset password for Flutter
        isSpotlight: true
        code: |

  - id: invoke
    title: 'invoke()'
    description: |
      Invokes a Supabase Function. See the [guide](/docs/guides/functions) for details on writing Functions.
    notes: |
      - Requires an Authorization header.
      - Invoke params generally match the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) spec.
    examples:
      - id: basic-invocation
        name: Basic invocation.

          await supabase.Functions.Invoke<HelloResponse>("hello");
          ```
  - id: select
    description: |
      Performs vertical filtering with SELECT.
    title: 'Fetch data: Select()'
    notes: |
      - **LINQ expressions do not currently support parsing embedded resource columns. For these cases, `string` will need to be used.**
      - **When using string Column Names to select, they must match names in database, not names specified on model properties.**
      - Additional information on modeling + querying Joins and Inner Joins can be found [in the `postgrest-csharp README`](https://github.com/supabase-community/postgrest-csharp/blob/master/README.md#foreign-keys-join-tables-and-relationships)
      - By default, Supabase projects will return a maximum of 1,000 rows. This setting can be changed in Project API Settings. It's recommended that you keep it low to limit the payload size of accidental or malicious requests. You can use `range()` queries to paginate through your data.
      - `From()` can be combined with [Modifiers](/docs/reference/csharp/using-modifiers)
      - `From()` can be combined with [Filters](/docs/reference/csharp/using-filters)
      - If using the Supabase hosted platform `apikey` is technically a reserved keyword, since the API gateway will pluck it out for authentication. [It should be avoided as a column name](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/issues/5465).

          If you have data inside of a JSONB column, you can apply select
          and query filters to the data values. Postgres offers a
          [number of operators](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html)
          for querying JSON data. Also see
          [PostgREST docs](http://postgrest.org/en/v7.0.0/api.html#json-columns) for more details.

  - id: update
    description: |
      Performs an UPDATE on the table.
    title: 'Modify data: Update()'
    notes: |
      - `Update()` is typically called using a model as an argument or from a hydrated model.
    examples:
      - id: updating-your-data-with-filter
        name: Update your data using Filter
        isSpotlight: true
        code: |
          ```c#

          await model.Update<City>();
          ```

  - id: upsert
    description: |
      Performs an UPSERT into the table.
    title: 'Upsert data: Upsert()'
    notes: |
      - Primary keys should be included in the data payload in order for an update to work correctly.
      - Primary keys must be natural, not surrogate. There are however, [workarounds](https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/issues/1118) for surrogate primary keys.
    examples:
      - id: upsert-your-data
        name: Upsert your data
        isSpotlight: true
        code: |
          ```c#

          Running the following will cause supabase to upsert data into the `users` table.
          If the username 'supabot' already exists, the `onConflict` argument tells supabase to overwrite that row
          based on the column passed into `onConflict`.

          ```

  - id: delete
    description: |
      Performs a DELETE on the table.
    title: 'Delete data: Delete()'
    notes: |
      - `Delete()` should always be combined with [Filters](/docs/reference/csharp/using-filters) to target the item(s) you wish to delete.
    examples:
      - id: delete-records
        name: Delete records
        isSpotlight: true
        code: |
          ```c#
          await supabase
            .From<City>()
            .Where(x => x.Id == 342)
            .Delete();
          ```

  - id: rpc
    title: 'Stored Procedures: Rpc()'
    description: |
      You can call stored procedures as a "Remote Procedure Call".

      That's a fancy way of saying that you can put some logic into your database then call it from anywhere.
      It's especially useful when the logic rarely changes - like password resets and updates.
    examples:
      - id: call-a-stored-procedure
        name: Call a stored procedure
        isSpotlight: true
        description: This is an example invoking a stored procedure.

          ```
      - id: with-parameters
        name: With Parameters
        code: |
          ```c#
          await supabase.Rpc("hello_world", new Dictionary<string, object> { { "foo", "bar"} });
          ```

  - id: subscribe
    title: 'Realtime.Channel'
    description: |
      Subscribe to realtime changes in your database.
    notes: |
      - Realtime is disabled by default for new Projects for better database performance and security. You can turn it on by [managing replication](/docs/guides/api#managing-realtime).
      - If you want to receive the "previous" data for updates and deletes, you will need to set `REPLICA IDENTITY` to `FULL`, like this: `ALTER TABLE your_table REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;`
    examples:
      - id: listen-to-broadcast

    description: |
      Unsubscribes and removes Realtime channel from Realtime client.
    title: 'Unsubscribe()'
    notes: |
      - Removing a channel is a great way to maintain the performance of your project's Realtime service as well as your database if you're listening to Postgres changes. Supabase will automatically handle cleanup 30 seconds after a client is disconnected, but unused channels may cause degradation as more clients are simultaneously subscribed.
    examples:

      only match certain conditions without changing the shape of the rows.
      Modifiers are everything that don't fit that definition—allowing you to
      change the format of the response (e.g., setting a limit or offset).

          Uses PostgreSQL's `websearch_to_tsquery` function.
          This function will never raise syntax errors, which makes it possible to use raw user-supplied input for search, and can be used
          with advanced operators.

          - `unquoted text`: text not inside quote marks will be converted to terms separated by & operators, as if processed by plainto_tsquery.
          - `"quoted text"`: text inside quote marks will be converted to terms separated by <-> operators, as if processed by phraseto_tsquery.
          - `OR`: the word “or” will be converted to the | operator.
          - `-`: a dash will be converted to the ! operator.

        code: |
          ```c#
          var result = await supabase.From<Quote>()
            .Select(x => x.Catchphrase)
            .Filter(x => x.Catchphrase, Operator.WFTS, new FullTextSearchConfig("'fat' & 'cat", "english"))
            .Get();
