      You can initialize a new Supabase client using the `createClient()` method.

      The Supabase client is your entrypoint to the rest of the Supabase functionality
      and is the easiest way to interact with everything we offer within the Supabase ecosystem.

    examples:
      - id: create-client
        name: Creating a client
        code: |
          ```js
          import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

          // Create a single supabase client for interacting with your database
          const supabase = createClient('https://xyzcompany.supabase.co', 'public-anon-key')
          ```

        code: |
          ```js
          import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

          // Use a custom domain as the supabase URL
          const supabase = createClient('https://my-custom-domain.com', 'public-anon-key')
          ```

          const options = {
            db: {
              schema: 'public',
            },

              persistSession: true,
              detectSessionInUrl: true
            },
            global: {
              headers: { 'x-my-custom-header': 'my-app-name' },
            },
          }
          const supabase = createClient("https://xyzcompany.supabase.co", "public-anon-key", options)
          ```
      - id: api-schemas
        name: With custom schemas
        code: |
          ```js
          import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

          const supabase = createClient('https://xyzcompany.supabase.co', 'public-anon-key', {
            // Provide a custom schema. Defaults to "public".
            db: { schema: 'other_schema' }
          })
          ```
        description: |
          By default the API server points to the `public` schema. You can enable other database schemas within the Dashboard.
          Go to [Settings > API > Exposed schemas](/dashboard/project/_/settings/api) and add the schema which you want to expose to the API.

          Note: each client connection can only access a single schema, so the code above can access the `other_schema` schema but cannot access the `public` schema.

            global: { fetch: fetch.bind(globalThis) }
          })
          ```
        description: |
          `supabase-js` uses the [`cross-fetch`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cross-fetch) library to make HTTP requests,
          but an alternative `fetch` implementation can be provided as an option.
          This is most useful in environments where `cross-fetch` is not compatible (for instance Cloudflare Workers).

          If you wish to encrypt the user's session information, you can use `aes-js` and store the encryption key in Expo SecureStore. The `aes-js` library, a reputable JavaScript-only implementation of the AES encryption algorithm in CTR mode. A new 256-bit encryption key is generated using the `react-native-get-random-values` library. This key is stored inside Expo's SecureStore, while the value is encrypted and placed inside AsyncStorage.

          Please make sure that:
          - You keep the `expo-secure-storage`, `aes-js` and `react-native-get-random-values` libraries up-to-date.
          - Choose the correct [`SecureStoreOptions`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/securestore/#securestoreoptions) for your app's needs. E.g. [`SecureStore.WHEN_UNLOCKED`](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/securestore/#securestorewhen_unlocked) regulates when the data can be accessed.
          - Carefully consider optimizations or other modifications to the above example, as those can lead to introducing subtle security vulnerabilities.
  - id: auth-api
    title: 'Overview'
    notes: |
      - The auth methods can be accessed via the `supabase.auth` namespace.
      - By default, the supabase client sets `persistSession` to true and attempts to store the session in local storage. When using the supabase client in an environment that doesn't support local storage, you might notice the following warning message being logged:

        > No storage option exists to persist the session, which may result in unexpected behavior when using auth. If you want to set `persistSession` to true, please provide a storage option or you may set `persistSession` to false to disable this warning.

        This warning message can be safely ignored if you're not using auth on the server-side. If you are using auth and you want to set `persistSession` to true, you will need to provide a custom storage implementation that follows [this interface](https://github.com/supabase/gotrue-js/blob/master/src/lib/types.ts#L1027).
      - Any email links and one-time passwords (OTPs) sent have a default expiry of 24 hours. We have the following [rate limits](/docs/guides/platform/going-into-prod#auth-rate-limits) in place to guard against brute force attacks.
      - The expiry of an access token can be set in the "JWT expiry limit" field in [your project's auth settings](/dashboard/project/_/settings/auth). A refresh token never expires and can only be used once.

    $ref: '@supabase/auth-js.GoTrueClient.signUp'
    notes: |
      - By default, the user needs to verify their email address before logging in. To turn this off, disable **Confirm email** in [your project](/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers).
      - **Confirm email** determines if users need to confirm their email address after signing up.
        - If **Confirm email** is enabled, a `user` is returned but `session` is null.
        - If **Confirm email** is disabled, both a `user` and a `session` are returned.
      - When the user confirms their email address, they are redirected to the [`SITE_URL`](/docs/guides/auth/concepts/redirect-urls) by default. You can modify your `SITE_URL` or add additional redirect URLs in [your project](/dashboard/project/_/auth/url-configuration).
      - If signUp() is called for an existing confirmed user:
        - When both **Confirm email** and **Confirm phone** (even when phone provider is disabled) are enabled in [your project](/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers), an obfuscated/fake user object is returned.
        - When either **Confirm email** or **Confirm phone** (even when phone provider is disabled) is disabled, the error message, `User already registered` is returned.
      - To fetch the currently logged-in user, refer to [`getUser()`](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-getuser).

    title: 'onAuthStateChange()'
    $ref: '@supabase/auth-js.GoTrueClient.onAuthStateChange'
    notes: |
      - Subscribes to important events occurring on the user's session.
      - Use on the frontend/client. It is less useful on the server.
      - Events are emitted across tabs to keep your application's UI up-to-date. Some events can fire very frequently, based on the number of tabs open. Use a quick and efficient callback function, and defer or debounce as many operations as you can to be performed outside of the callback.
      - **Important:** A callback can be an `async` function and it runs synchronously during the processing of the changes causing the event. You can easily create a dead-lock by using `await` on a call to another method of the Supabase library.
        - Avoid using `async` functions as callbacks.
        - Limit the number of `await` calls in `async` callbacks.
        - Do not use other Supabase functions in the callback function. If you must, dispatch the functions once the callback has finished executing. Use this as a quick way to achieve this:
          ```js
          supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange((event, session) => {
            setTimeout(async () => {
              // await on other Supabase function here
              // this runs right after the callback has finished
            }, 0)
          })
          ```
      - Emitted events:
        - `INITIAL_SESSION`
          - Emitted right after the Supabase client is constructed and the initial session from storage is loaded.
        - `SIGNED_IN`
          - Emitted each time a user session is confirmed or re-established, including on user sign in and when refocusing a tab. 
          - Avoid making assumptions as to when this event is fired, this may occur even when the user is already signed in. Instead, check the user object attached to the event to see if a new user has signed in and update your application's UI.
          - This event can fire very frequently depending on the number of tabs open in your application.
        - `SIGNED_OUT`
          - Emitted when the user signs out. This can be after:
            - A call to `supabase.auth.signOut()`.
            - After the user's session has expired for any reason:
              - User has signed out on another device.
              - The session has reached its timebox limit or inactivity timeout.
              - User has signed in on another device with single session per user enabled.
              - Check the [User Sessions](/docs/guides/auth/sessions) docs for more information.
          - Use this to clean up any local storage your application has associated with the user.
        - `TOKEN_REFRESHED`
          - Emitted each time a new access and refresh token are fetched for the signed in user.
          - It's best practice and highly recommended to extract the access token (JWT) and store it in memory for further use in your application.
            - Avoid frequent calls to `supabase.auth.getSession()` for the same purpose.
          - There is a background process that keeps track of when the session should be refreshed so you will always receive valid tokens by listening to this event.
          - The frequency of this event is related to the JWT expiry limit configured on your project.
        - `USER_UPDATED`
          - Emitted each time the `supabase.auth.updateUser()` method finishes successfully. Listen to it to update your application's UI based on new profile information.
        - `PASSWORD_RECOVERY`
          - Emitted instead of the `SIGNED_IN` event when the user lands on a page that includes a password recovery link in the URL.
          - Use it to show a UI to the user where they can [reset their password](/docs/guides/auth/passwords#resetting-a-users-password-forgot-password).

        name: Store OAuth provider tokens on sign in
        description: |
          When using [OAuth (Social Login)](/docs/guides/auth/social-login) you sometimes wish to get access to the provider's access token and refresh token, in order to call provider APIs in the name of the user.

          For example, if you are using [Sign in with Google](/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-google) you may want to use the provider token to call Google APIs on behalf of the user. Supabase Auth does not keep track of the provider access and refresh token, but does return them for you once, immediately after sign in. You can use the `onAuthStateChange` method to listen for the presence of the provider tokens and store them in local storage. You can further send them to your server's APIs for use on the backend.

          Finally, make sure you remove them from local storage on the `SIGNED_OUT` event. If the OAuth provider supports token revocation, make sure you call those APIs either from the frontend or schedule them to be called on the backend.
        code: |
          ```js
          // Register this immediately after calling createClient!
          // Because signInWithOAuth causes a redirect, you need to fetch the
          // provider tokens from the callback.
          supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange((event, session) => {
            if (session && session.provider_token) {
              window.localStorage.setItem('oauth_provider_token', session.provider_token)
            }

            if (session && session.provider_refresh_token) {
              window.localStorage.setItem('oauth_provider_refresh_token', session.provider_refresh_token)
            }

            if (event === 'SIGNED_OUT') {

    notes: |
      - Requires either an email or phone number.
      - This method is used for passwordless sign-ins where a OTP is sent to the user's email or phone number.
      - If the user doesn't exist, `signInWithOtp()` will signup the user instead. To restrict this behavior, you can set `shouldCreateUser` in `SignInWithPasswordlessCredentials.options` to `false`.
      - If you're using an email, you can configure whether you want the user to receive a magiclink or a OTP.
      - If you're using phone, you can configure whether you want the user to receive a OTP.
      - The magic link's destination URL is determined by the [`SITE_URL`](/docs/guides/auth/concepts/redirect-urls).
      - See [redirect URLs and wildcards](/docs/guides/auth#redirect-urls-and-wildcards) to add additional redirect URLs to your project.
      - Magic links and OTPs share the same implementation. To send users a one-time code instead of a magic link, [modify the magic link email template](/dashboard/project/_/auth/templates) to include `{{ .Token }}` instead of `{{ .ConfirmationURL }}`.
      - See our [Twilio Phone Auth Guide](/docs/guides/auth/phone-login/twilio) for details about configuring WhatsApp sign in.

    notes: |
      - This method is used for signing in using a third-party provider.
      - Supabase supports many different [third-party providers](/docs/guides/auth#configure-third-party-providers).
    examples:
      - id: sign-in-using-a-third-party-provider

        description: |
          - When the third-party provider successfully authenticates the user, the provider redirects the user to the URL specified in the `redirectTo` parameter. This parameter defaults to the [`SITE_URL`](/docs/guides/auth/concepts/redirect-urls). It does not redirect the user immediately after invoking this method.
          - See [redirect URLs and wildcards](/docs/guides/auth#redirect-urls-and-wildcards) to add additional redirect URLs to your project.

        isSpotlight: false
        description: |
          If you need additional access from an OAuth provider, in order to access provider specific APIs in the name of the user, you can do this by passing in the scopes the user should authorize for your application. Note that the `scopes` option takes in **a space-separated list** of scopes.

          Because OAuth sign-in often includes redirects, you should register an `onAuthStateChange` callback immediately after you create the Supabase client. This callback will listen for the presence of `provider_token` and `provider_refresh_token` properties on the `session` object and store them in local storage. The client library will emit these values **only once** immediately after the user signs in. You can then access them by looking them up in local storage, or send them to your backend servers for further processing.

          Finally, make sure you remove them from local storage on the `SIGNED_OUT` event. If the OAuth provider supports token revocation, make sure you call those APIs either from the frontend or schedule them to be called on the backend.
        code: |
          ```js
          // Register this immediately after calling createClient!
          // Because signInWithOAuth causes a redirect, you need to fetch the
          // provider tokens from the callback.
          supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange((event, session) => {
            if (session && session.provider_token) {
              window.localStorage.setItem('oauth_provider_token', session.provider_token)

    title: 'signInWithSSO()'
    $ref: '@supabase/auth-js.GoTrueClient.signInWithSSO'
    notes: |
      - Before you can call this method you need to [establish a connection](/docs/guides/auth/sso/auth-sso-saml#managing-saml-20-connections) to an identity provider. Use the [CLI commands](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-sso) to do this.
      - If you've associated an email domain to the identity provider, you can use the `domain` property to start a sign-in flow.
      - In case you need to use a different way to start the authentication flow with an identity provider, you can use the `providerId` property. For example:
          - Mapping specific user email addresses with an identity provider.
          - Using different hints to identity the identity provider to be used by the user, like a company-specific page, IP address or other tracking information.
    examples:
      - id: sign-in-with-domain
        name: Sign in with email domain
        isSpotlight: true

  - id: sign-out
    title: 'signOut()'
    $ref: '@supabase/auth-js.GoTrueClient.signOut'
    notes: |
      - In order to use the `signOut()` method, the user needs to be signed in first.
      - By default, `signOut()` uses the global scope, which signs out all other sessions that the user is logged into as well.
      - Since Supabase Auth uses JWTs for authentication, the access token JWT will be valid until it's expired. When the user signs out, Supabase revokes the refresh token and deletes the JWT from the client-side. This does not revoke the JWT and it will still be valid until it expires.
    examples:
      - id: sign-out
        name: Sign out
        isSpotlight: true

  - id: verify-otp
    title: 'verifyOtp()'
    $ref: '@supabase/auth-js.GoTrueClient.verifyOtp'
    notes: |
      - The `verifyOtp` method takes in different verification types. If a phone number is used, the type can either be `sms` or `phone_change`. If an email address is used, the type can be one of the following: `email`, `recovery`, `invite` or `email_change` (`signup` and `magiclink` types are deprecated).
      - The verification type used should be determined based on the corresponding auth method called before `verifyOtp` to sign up / sign-in a user.
      - The `TokenHash` is contained in the [email templates](/docs/guides/auth/auth-email-templates) and can be used to sign in. You may wish to use the hash with Magic Links for the PKCE flow for Server Side Auth. See [this guide](/docs/guides/auth/server-side/email-based-auth-with-pkce-flow-for-ssr) for more details.

  - id: get-session
    title: 'getSession()'
    $ref: '@supabase/auth-js.GoTrueClient.getSession'
    notes: |
      - This method retrieves the current local session (i.e local storage).
      - The session contains a signed JWT and unencoded session data.
      - Since the unencoded session data is retrieved from the local storage medium, **do not** rely on it as a source of trusted data on the server. It could be tampered with by the sender. If you need verified, trustworthy user data, call [`getUser`](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-getuser) instead.
      - If the session has an expired access token, this method will use the refresh token to get a new session.
    examples:
      - id: get-the-session-data
        name: Get the session data
        isSpotlight: true
        code: |

    $ref: '@supabase/auth-js.GoTrueClient.startAutoRefresh'
    notes: |
      - Only useful in non-browser environments such as React Native or Electron.
      - The Supabase Auth library automatically starts and stops proactively refreshing the session when a tab is focused or not.
      - On non-browser platforms, such as mobile or desktop apps built with web technologies, the library is not able to effectively determine whether the application is _focused_ or not.
      - To give this hint to the application, you should be calling this method when the app is in focus and calling `supabase.auth.stopAutoRefresh()` when it's out of focus.

    notes: |
      - Only useful in non-browser environments such as React Native or Electron.
      - The Supabase Auth library automatically starts and stops proactively refreshing the session when a tab is focused or not.
      - On non-browser platforms, such as mobile or desktop apps built with web technologies, the library is not able to effectively determine whether the application is _focused_ or not.
      - When your application goes in the background or out of focus, call this method to stop the proactive refreshing of the session.

    notes: |
      - This method fetches the user object from the database instead of local session.
      - This method is useful for checking if the user is authorized because it validates the user's access token JWT on the server.
      - Should always be used when checking for user authorization on the server. On the client, you can instead use `getSession().session.user` for faster results. `getSession` is insecure on the server.

    notes: |
      - In order to use the `updateUser()` method, the user needs to be signed in first.
      - By default, email updates sends a confirmation link to both the user's current and new email.
      To only send a confirmation link to the user's new email, disable **Secure email change** in your project's [email auth provider settings](/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers).

    notes: |
      - This method is used together with `updateUser()` when a user's password needs to be updated.
      - If you require your user to reauthenticate before updating their password, you need to enable the **Secure password change** option in your [project's email provider settings](/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers).
      - A user is only require to reauthenticate before updating their password if **Secure password change** is enabled and the user **hasn't recently signed in**. A user is deemed recently signed in if the session was created in the last 24 hours.
      - This method will send a nonce to the user's email. If the user doesn't have a confirmed email address, the method will send the nonce to the user's confirmed phone number instead.

    notes: |
      - `setSession()` takes in a refresh token and uses it to get a new session.
      - The refresh token can only be used once to obtain a new session.
      - [Refresh token rotation](/docs/reference/auth/config#refresh_token_rotation_enabled) is enabled by default on all projects to guard against replay attacks.
      - You can configure the [`REFRESH_TOKEN_REUSE_INTERVAL`](/docs/reference/auth/config#refresh_token_reuse_interval) which provides a short window in which the same refresh token can be used multiple times in the event of concurrency or offline issues.

    title: 'Overview'
    notes: |
      This section contains methods commonly used for Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and are invoked behind the `supabase.auth.mfa` namespace.

      Currently, we only support time-based one-time password (TOTP) as the 2nd factor. We don't support recovery codes but we allow users to enroll more than 1 TOTP factor, with an upper limit of 10.

      Having a 2nd TOTP factor for recovery frees the user of the burden of having to store their recovery codes somewhere. It also reduces the attack surface since multiple recovery codes are usually generated compared to just having 1 backup TOTP factor.

    notes: |
      - Currently, `totp` is the only supported `factorType`. The returned `id` should be used to create a challenge.
      - To create a challenge, see [`mfa.challenge()`](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-mfa-challenge).
      - To verify a challenge, see [`mfa.verify()`](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-mfa-verify).
      - To create and verify a challenge in a single step, see [`mfa.challengeAndVerify()`](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-mfa-challengeandverify).
      - To generate a QR code for the `totp` secret in nextjs, you can do the following:
      ```html
      <Image src={data.totp.qr_code} alt={data.totp.uri} layout="fill"></Image>

    notes: |
      - Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL) is the measure of the strength of an authentication mechanism.
      - In Supabase, having an AAL of `aal1` refers to having the 1st factor of authentication such as an email and password or OAuth sign-in while `aal2` refers to the 2nd factor of authentication such as a time-based, one-time-password (TOTP).
      - If the user has a verified factor, the `nextLevel` field will return `aal2`, else, it will return `aal1`.

  - id: create-user
    title: 'createUser()'
    $ref: '@supabase/auth-js.GoTrueAdminApi.createUser'
    notes: |
      - To confirm the user's email address or phone number, set `email_confirm` or `phone_confirm` to true. Both arguments default to false.
      - `createUser()` will not send a confirmation email to the user. You can use [`inviteUserByEmail()`](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-admin-inviteuserbyemail) if you want to send them an email invite instead.
      - If you are sure that the created user's email or phone number is legitimate and verified, you can set the `email_confirm` or `phone_confirm` param to `true`.

      - id: create-a-new-user-with-custom-user-metadata

  - id: invite-user-by-email
    title: 'inviteUserByEmail()'
    $ref: '@supabase/auth-js.GoTrueAdminApi.inviteUserByEmail'
    notes: |
      - Sends an invite link to the user's email address.
      - The `inviteUserByEmail()` method is typically used by administrators to invite users to join the application.
      - Note that PKCE is not supported when using `inviteUserByEmail`. This is because the browser initiating the invite is often different from the browser accepting the invite which makes it difficult to provide the security guarantees required of the PKCE flow.
    examples:
      - id: invite-a-user
        name: Invite a user
        isSpotlight: true
        code: |
          ```js

  - id: reset-password-for-email
    title: 'resetPasswordForEmail()'
    $ref: '@supabase/auth-js.GoTrueClient.resetPasswordForEmail'
    notes: |
      - The password reset flow consist of 2 broad steps: (i) Allow the user to login via the password reset link; (ii) Update the user's password.
      - The `resetPasswordForEmail()` only sends a password reset link to the user's email.
      To update the user's password, see [`updateUser()`](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-updateuser).
      - A `SIGNED_IN` and `PASSWORD_RECOVERY` event will be emitted when the password recovery link is clicked.
      You can use [`onAuthStateChange()`](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-onauthstatechange) to listen and invoke a callback function on these events.
      - When the user clicks the reset link in the email they are redirected back to your application.
      You can configure the URL that the user is redirected to with the `redirectTo` parameter.
      See [redirect URLs and wildcards](/docs/guides/auth#redirect-urls-and-wildcards) to add additional redirect URLs to your project.
      - After the user has been redirected successfully, prompt them for a new password and call `updateUser()`:
      ```js
      const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.updateUser({
        password: new_password
      })
      ```
    examples:
      - id: reset-password

           */
          const { data, error } = await supabase.auth
            .resetPasswordForEmail('user@email.com')

          /**

           * ask the user to reset their password.
           */
           useEffect(() => {
             supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange(async (event, session) => {
               if (event == "PASSWORD_RECOVERY") {

                 const { data, error } = await supabase.auth
                   .updateUser({ password: newPassword })

                 if (data) alert("Password updated successfully!")

    notes: |
      - The following types can be passed into `generateLink()`: `signup`, `magiclink`, `invite`, `recovery`, `email_change_current`, `email_change_new`, `phone_change`.
      - `generateLink()` only generates the email link for `email_change_email` if the **Secure email change** is enabled in your project's [email auth provider settings](/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers).
      - `generateLink()` handles the creation of the user for `signup`, `invite` and `magiclink`.

    notes: |
      - By default, Supabase projects return a maximum of 1,000 rows. This setting can be changed in your project's [API settings](/dashboard/project/_/settings/api). It's recommended that you keep it low to limit the payload size of accidental or malicious requests. You can use `range()` queries to paginate through your data.
      - `select()` can be combined with [Filters](/docs/reference/javascript/using-filters)
      - `select()` can be combined with [Modifiers](/docs/reference/javascript/using-modifiers)
      - `apikey` is a reserved keyword if you're using the [Supabase Platform](/docs/guides/platform) and [should be avoided as a column name](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/issues/5465).

          In the following query, `upsert()` implicitly uses the `id`
          (primary key) column to determine conflicts. If there is no existing
          row with the same `id`, `upsert()` inserts a new row, which
          will fail in this case as there is already a row with `handle` `"saoirse"`.
          Using the `onConflict` option, you can instruct `upsert()` to use
          another column with a unique constraint to determine conflicts.

    title: Using Filters
    description: |
      Filters allow you to only return rows that match certain conditions.

      Filters can be used on `select()`, `update()`, `upsert()`, and `delete()` queries.

      If a Postgres function returns a table response, you can also apply filters.
    examples:
      - id: applying-filters
        name: Applying Filters
        description: |
          Filters must be applied after any of `select()`, `update()`, `upsert()`,
          `delete()`, and `rpc()` and before
          [modifiers](/docs/reference/javascript/using-modifiers).
        code: |
          ```ts
          const { data, error } = await supabase
            .from('cities')
            .select('name, country_id')
            .eq('name', 'The Shire')    // Correct

          const { data, error } = await supabase
            .from('cities')
            .eq('name', 'The Shire')    // Incorrect
            .select('name, country_id')
          ```
      - id: chaining-filters
        name: Chaining
        description: |
          Filters can be chained together to produce advanced queries. For example,
          to query cities with population between 1,000 and 10,000:

          ```ts
          const { data, error } = await supabase
            .from('cities')
            .select('name, country_id')
            .gte('population', 1000)
            .lt('population', 10000)
          ```
        code: |
          ```ts
          const { data, error } = await supabase
            .from('cities')
            .select('name, country_id')
            .gte('population', 1000)
            .lt('population', 10000)
          ```
      - id: conditional-chaining
        name: Conditional Chaining
        description: |
          Filters can be built up one step at a time and then executed. For example:

          ```ts
          const filterByName = null
          const filterPopLow = 1000
          const filterPopHigh = 10000

          let query = supabase
            .from('cities')
            .select('name, country_id')

          if (filterByName)  { query = query.eq('name', filterByName) }
          if (filterPopLow)  { query = query.gte('population', filterPopLow) }
          if (filterPopHigh) { query = query.lt('population', filterPopHigh) }

          const { data, error } = await query
          ```
        code: |
          ```ts
          const filterByName = null
          const filterPopLow = 1000
          const filterPopHigh = 10000

          let query = supabase
            .from('cities')
            .select('name, country_id')

          if (filterByName)  { query = query.eq('name', filterByName) }
          if (filterPopLow)  { query = query.gte('population', filterPopLow) }
          if (filterPopHigh) { query = query.lt('population', filterPopHigh) }

          const { data, error } = await query

          This function will never raise syntax errors, which makes it possible to use raw user-supplied input for search, and can be used
          with advanced operators.

          - `unquoted text`: text not inside quote marks will be converted to terms separated by & operators, as if processed by plainto_tsquery.
          - `"quoted text"`: text inside quote marks will be converted to terms separated by <-> operators, as if processed by phraseto_tsquery.
          - `OR`: the word “or” will be converted to the | operator.
          - `-`: a dash will be converted to the ! operator.

    title: Using Modifiers
    description: |
      Filters work on the row level—they allow you to return rows that
      only match certain conditions without changing the shape of the rows.
      Modifiers are everything that don't fit that definition—allowing you to
      change the format of the response (e.g., returning a CSV string).

      Modifiers must be specified after filters. Some modifiers only apply for
      queries that return rows (e.g., `select()` or `rpc()` on a function that
      returns a table response).

    title: Using Explain
    description: |
      For debugging slow queries, you can get the [Postgres `EXPLAIN` execution plan](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-explain.html) of a query
      using the `explain()` method. This works on any query, even for `rpc()` or writes.

      Explain is not enabled by default as it can reveal sensitive information about your database.
      It's best to only enable this for testing environments but if you wish to enable it for production you can provide additional protection by using a `pre-request` function.

      Follow the [Performance Debugging Guide](/docs/guides/database/debugging-performance) to enable the functionality on your project.

      Invoke a Supabase Edge Function.
    $ref: '@supabase/functions-js.FunctionsClient.invoke'
    notes: |
      - Requires an Authorization header.
      - Invoke params generally match the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) spec.
      - When you pass in a body to your function, we automatically attach the Content-Type header for `Blob`, `ArrayBuffer`, `File`, `FormData` and `String`. If it doesn't match any of these types we assume the payload is `json`, serialize it and attach the `Content-Type` header as `application/json`. You can override this behavior by passing in a `Content-Type` header of your own.
      - Responses are automatically parsed as `json`, `blob` and `form-data` depending on the `Content-Type` header sent by your function. Responses are parsed as `text` by default.

    notes: |
      - By default, Broadcast and Presence are enabled for all projects.
      - By default, listening to database changes is disabled for new projects due to database performance and security concerns. You can turn it on by managing Realtime's [replication](/docs/guides/api#realtime-api-overview).
      - You can receive the "previous" data for updates and deletes by setting the table's `REPLICA IDENTITY` to `FULL` (e.g., `ALTER TABLE your_table REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;`).
      - Row level security is not applied to delete statements. When RLS is enabled and replica identity is set to full, only the primary key is sent to clients.
