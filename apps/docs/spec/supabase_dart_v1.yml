      You can initialize Supabase with the static `initialize()` method of `Supabase` class.

      The Supabase client is your entrypoint to the rest of the Supabase functionality
      and is the easiest way to interact with everything we offer within the Supabase ecosystem.

    examples:
      - id: flutter-initialize
        name: For Flutter
        code: |
          ```dart
          Future<void> main() async {
            await Supabase.initialize(
              url: 'https://xyzcompany.supabase.co',
              anonKey: 'public-anon-key',
            );

            runApp(MyApp());
          }

          // Get a reference your Supabase client
          final supabase = Supabase.instance.client;
          ```

        code: |
          ```dart
          final supabase = SupabaseClient(
            'https://xyzcompany.supabase.co',
            'public-anon-key',
          );
          ```
  - id: sign-up
    title: 'signUp()'
    description: |
      Creates a new user.
    notes: |
      - By default, the user needs to verify their email address before logging in. To turn this off, disable **Confirm email** in [your project](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers).
      - **Confirm email** determines if users need to confirm their email address after signing up.
        - If **Confirm email** is enabled, a `user` is returned but `session` is null.
        - If **Confirm email** is disabled, both a `user` and a `session` are returned.
      - When the user confirms their email address, they are redirected to the [`SITE_URL`](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/redirect-urls) by default. You can modify your `SITE_URL` or add additional redirect URLs in [your project](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/url-configuration).
      - If signUp() is called for an existing confirmed user:
          - If **Confirm email** is enabled in [your project](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers), an obfuscated/fake user object is returned.
          - If **Confirm email** is disabled, the error message, `User already registered` is returned.

  - id: sign-in-with-otp
    title: 'signInWithOtp()'
    notes: |
      - Requires either an email or phone number.
      - This method is used for passwordless sign-ins where a OTP is sent to the user's email or phone number.
      - If you're using an email, you can configure whether you want the user to receive a magiclink or a OTP.
      - If you're using phone, you can configure whether you want the user to receive a OTP.
      - The magic link's destination URL is determined by the [`SITE_URL`](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/redirect-urls). You can modify the `SITE_URL` or add additional redirect urls in [your project](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/url-configuration).
    examples:
      - id: sign-in-with-email
        name: Sign in with email.
        isSpotlight: true
        description: |
          The user will be sent an email which contains either a magiclink or a OTP or both. By default, a given user can only request a OTP once every 60 seconds.
          You can pass `emailRedirectTo` with dynamic link to bring the users back to your app after they click on the magic link.
        code: |
          ```dart
          await supabase.auth.signInWithOtp(
            email: 'example@email.com',
            emailRedirectTo: kIsWeb ? null : 'io.supabase.flutter://signin-callback/',
          );

    title: 'signInWithApple()'
    description: |
      Signs in a user using native Apple login.
    notes: |
      - You need to [register your bundle ID](https://developer.apple.com/help/account/manage-identifiers/register-an-app-id/) and add it to Supabase dashboard.
      - This method is only available in iOS and macOS
      - For other platforms, [signInWithOAuth()](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/dart/auth-signinwithoauth) should be used.
    examples:
      - id: sign-in-with-apple
        name: Sign in with Apple
        isSpotlight: true
        code: |
          ```dart

  - id: sign-in-with-oauth
    title: 'signInWithOAuth()'
    description: |
      Signs the user in using third party OAuth providers.
    notes: |
      - This method is used for signing in using a third-party provider.
      - Supabase supports many different [third-party providers](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth#providers).
    examples:
      - id: sign-in-using-a-third-party-provider
        name: Sign in using a third-party provider
        isSpotlight: true
        code: |
          ```dart

          ```
      - id: sign-in-using-a-third-party-provider-with-redirect
        name: With `redirectTo`
        description: |
          Specify the redirect link to bring back the user via deeplink.
          Note that `redirectTo` should be null for Flutter Web.
        code: |
          ```dart
          await supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth(
            Provider.github,
            redirectTo: kIsWeb ? null : 'io.supabase.flutter://reset-callback/',
          );
          ```
      - id: sign-in-with-scopes
        name: With scopes
        description: |
          If you need additional data from an OAuth provider, you can include a space-separated list of scopes in your request to get back an OAuth provider token.
          You may also need to specify the scopes in the provider's OAuth app settings, depending on the provider.
        code: |
          ```dart
          await supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth(
            Provider.github,
            scopes: 'repo gist notifications'
          );
          ...
          // after user comes back from signin flow

          final Session? session = supabase.auth.currentSession;
          final String? oAuthToken = session?.providerToken;
          ```
  - id: sign-out
    title: 'signOut()'
    description: |
      Signs out the current user, if there is a logged in user.
    notes: |
      - In order to use the `signOut()` method, the user needs to be signed in first.
    examples:
      - id: sign-out
        name: Sign out
        isSpotlight: true
        code: |
          ```dart
          await supabase.auth.signOut();
          ```
  - id: verify-otp
    title: 'verifyOtp()'
    notes: |
      - The `verifyOtp` method takes in different verification types. If a phone number is used, the type can either be `sms` or `phone_change`. If an email address is used, the type can be one of the following: `signup`, `magiclink`, `recovery`, `invite` or `email_change`.
      - The verification type used should be determined based on the corresponding auth method called before `verifyOtp` to sign up / sign-in a user.
    examples:
      - id: verify-sms-one-time-password(otp)
        name: Verify Sms One-Time Password (OTP)
        isSpotlight: true
        code: |

  - id: update-user
    title: 'updateUser()'
    description: |
      Updates user data for a logged in user.
    notes: |
      - In order to use the `updateUser()` method, the user needs to be signed in first.
      - By Default, email updates sends a confirmation link to both the user's current and new email.
      To only send a confirmation link to the user's new email, disable **Secure email change** in your project's [email auth provider settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers).
    examples:
      - id: update-the-email-for-an-authenticated-user

          ));
          ```
  - id: send-password-reauthentication
    title: 'reauthenticate()'
    notes: |
      - This method is used together with `updateUser()` when a user's password needs to be updated.
      - This method will send a nonce to the user's email. If the user doesn't have a confirmed email address, the method will send the nonce to the user's confirmed phone number instead.
    examples:
      - id: send-reauthentication-nonce

  - id: resend-email-or-phone-otps
    title: 'resend()'
    notes: |
      - Resends a signup confirmation, email change or phone change email to the user.
      - Passwordless sign-ins can be resent by calling the `signInWithOtp()` method again.
      - Password recovery emails can be resent by calling the `resetPasswordForEmail()` method again.
      - This method will only resend an email or phone OTP to the user if there was an initial signup, email change or phone change request being made.
    examples:
      - id: resend-email-signup-confirmation
        name: Resend an email signup confirmation
        description: Resends the email signup confirmation to the user

    notes: |
      Sends a password reset request to an email address. When the user clicks the reset link in the email they are redirected back to your application. Prompt the user for a new password and call auth.updateUser():

      ```dart
      await supabase.auth.resetPasswordForEmail(
        'sample@email.com',
        redirectTo: kIsWeb ? null : 'io.supabase.flutter://reset-callback/',

            'sample@email.com',
            redirectTo: kIsWeb ? null : 'io.supabase.flutter://reset-callback/',
          );
          ```
  - id: auth-mfa-api
    title: 'Overview'
    notes: |
      This section contains methods commonly used for Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and are invoked behind the `supabase.auth.mfa` namespace. 

      Currently, we only support time-based one-time password (TOTP) as the 2nd factor. We don't support recovery codes but we allow users to enroll more than 1 TOTP factor, with an upper limit of 10.

      Having a 2nd TOTP factor for recovery frees the user of the burden of having to store their recovery codes somewhere. It also reduces the attack surface since multiple recovery codes are usually generated compared to just having 1 backup TOTP factor.
  - id: mfa-enroll
    title: 'mfa.enroll()'

      Starts the enrollment process for a new Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) factor. This method creates a new `unverified` factor.
      To verify a factor, present the QR code or secret to the user and ask them to add it to their authenticator app.
      The user has to enter the code from their authenticator app to verify it.
      - Currently, `totp` is the only supported `factorType`. The returned `id` should be used to create a challenge.
      - To create a challenge, see [`mfa.challenge()`](/docs/reference/dart/auth-mfa-challenge).
      - To verify a challenge, see [`mfa.verify()`](/docs/reference/dart/auth-mfa-verify).
      - To create and verify a challenge in a single step, see [`mfa.challengeAndVerify()`](/docs/reference/dart/auth-mfa-challengeandverify).
    examples:
      - id: enroll-totp-factor
        name: Enroll a time-based, one-time password (TOTP) factor

      Verifies a code against a challenge. The verification code is provided by the user by entering a code seen in their authenticator app.
      - To verify a challenge, please [create a challenge](/docs/reference/dart/auth-mfa-challenge) first.
    examples:
      - id: verify-challenge
        name: Verify a challenge for a factor

    notes: |
      Helper method which creates a challenge and immediately uses the given code to verify against it thereafter. The verification code is provided by the user by entering a code seen in their authenticator app.
      - An [enrolled factor](/docs/reference/dart/auth-mfa-enroll) is required before invoking `challengeAndVerify()`.
      - Executes [`mfa.challenge()`](/docs/reference/dart/auth-mfa-challenge) and [`mfa.verify()`](/docs/reference/dart/auth-mfa-verify) in a single step.
    examples:
      - id: challenge-and-verify

          ```
  - id: mfa-unenroll
    title: 'mfa.unenroll()'
    notes: |
      Unenroll removes a MFA factor. A user has to have an aal2 authenticator level in order to unenroll a verified factor.
    examples:
      - id: unenroll-a-factor
        name: Unenroll a factor
        isSpotlight: true
        code: |
          ```dart
          final res = await supabase.auth.mfa.unenroll(
            '34e770dd-9ff9-416c-87fa-43b31d7ef225',

          ```
  - id: mfa-get-authenticator-assurance-level
    title: 'mfa.getAuthenticatorAssuranceLevel()'
    notes: |
      Returns the Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL) for the active session.
      - Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL) is the measure of the strength of an authentication mechanism.
      - In Supabase, having an AAL of `aal1` refers to having the 1st factor of authentication such as an email and password or OAuth sign-in while `aal2` refers to the 2nd factor of authentication such as a time-based, one-time-password (TOTP).
      - If the user has a verified factor, the `nextLevel` field will return `aal2`, else, it will return `aal1`.
    examples:
      - id: get-aal
        name: Get the AAL details of a session
        isSpotlight: true
        code: |
          ```dart
          final res = supabase.auth.mfa.getAuthenticatorAssuranceLevel();
          final currentLevel = res.currentLevel;
          final nextLevel = res.nextLevel;
          final currentAuthenticationMethods = res.currentAuthenticationMethods;
          ```
  - id: admin-api
    title: 'Overview'
    notes: |
      - Any method under the `supabase.auth.admin` namespace requires a `service_role` key.
      - These methods are considered admin methods and should be called on a trusted server. Never expose your `service_role` key in the Flutter app.
    examples:
      - id: create-auth-admin-client
        name: Create server-side auth client
        isSpotlight: true
        code: |
          ```dart
          final supabase = SupabaseClient(supabaseUrl, serviceRoleKey);
          ```
  - id: get-user-by-id
    title: 'getUserById()'
    notes: |
      Get user by id.
      - Fetches the user object from the database based on the user's id.
      - The `getUserById()` method requires the user's id which maps to the `auth.users.id` column.
    examples:
      - id: fetch-the-user-object-using-the-access-token-jwt
        name: Fetch the user object using the access_token jwt
        isSpotlight: true
        code: |
          ```dart
          final res = await supabase.auth.admin.getUserById(userId);
          final user = res.user;
          ```
  - id: list-users
    title: 'listUsers()'
    notes: |
      Get a list of users.
      - Defaults to return 50 users per page.
    examples:
      - id: get-a-full-list-of-users
        name: Get a page of users
        isSpotlight: true
        code: |
          ```dart
          final List<User> users = await supabase.auth.admin.listUsers();
          ```
      - id: get-paginated-list-of-users
        name: Paginated list of users

            perPage: 100,
          );
          ```
  - id: create-user
    title: 'createUser()'
    notes: |
      Creates a new user.
      - To confirm the user's email address or phone number, set `email_confirm` or `phone_confirm` to true. Both arguments default to false.
      - `createUser()` will not send a confirmation email to the user. You can use [`inviteUserByEmail()`](/docs/reference/dart/auth-admin-inviteuserbyemail) if you want to send them an email invite instead.
      - If you are sure that the created user's email or phone number is legitimate and verified, you can set the `email_confirm` or `phone_confirm` param to `true`.
    examples:
      - id: create-a-new-user-with-custom-user-metadata
        name: With custom user metadata
        isSpotlight: true
        code: |

            email: 'user@email.com',
            password: 'password',
            userMetadata: {'name': 'Yoda'},
          ));
          ```

          ));
          ```
      - id: auto-confirm-the-users-phone-number
        name: Auto-confirm the user's phone number
        code: |

            phone: '1234567890',
            phoneConfirm: true,
          ));
          ```
  - id: delete-user
    title: 'deleteUser()'
    notes: |
      Delete a user.
      - The `deleteUser()` method requires the user's ID, which maps to the `auth.users.id` column.
    examples:
      - id: removes-a-user
        name: Removes a user
        isSpotlight: true
        code: |
          ```dart
          await supabase.auth.admin

          ```
  - id: invite-user-by-email
    title: 'inviteUserByEmail()'
    notes: |
      Sends an invite link to the user's email address.
    examples:

          ```
  - id: generate-link
    title: 'generateLink()'
    notes: |
      Generates email links and OTPs to be sent via a custom email provider.
      - The following types can be passed into `generateLink()`: `signup`, `magiclink`, `invite`, `recovery`, `emailChangeCurrent`, `emailChangeNew`, `phoneChange`.
      - `generateLink()` only generates the email link for `email_change_email` if the "Secure email change" setting is enabled under the "Email" provider in your Supabase project.
      - `generateLink()` handles the creation of the user for `signup`, `invite` and `magiclink`.
    examples:
      - id: generate-a-signup-link
        name: Generate a signup link
        isSpotlight: true
        code: |
          ```dart

          ```
  - id: select
    description: |
      Perform a SELECT query on the table or view.
    title: 'Fetch data: select()'
    notes: |
      - By default, Supabase projects will return a maximum of 1,000 rows. This setting can be changed in Project API Settings. It's recommended that you keep it low to limit the payload size of accidental or malicious requests. You can use `range()` queries to paginate through your data.
      - `select()` can be combined with [Filters](/docs/reference/dart/using-filters)
      - `select()` can be combined with [Modifiers](/docs/reference/dart/using-modifiers)
      - `apikey` is a reserved keyword if you're using the [Supabase Platform](/docs/guides/platform) and [should be avoided as a column name](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/issues/5465).

  - id: upsert
    description: |
      Perform an UPSERT on the table or view. Depending on the column(s) passed to `onConflict`, `.upsert()` allows you to perform the equivalent of `.insert()` if a row with the corresponding `onConflict` columns doesn't exist, or if it does exist, perform an alternative action depending on `ignoreDuplicates`.
    title: 'Upsert data: upsert()'
    notes: |
      - Primary keys must be included in `values` to use upsert.
    examples:
      - id: upsert-your-data
        name: Upsert your data
        isSpotlight: true
        code: |
          ```dart

          Running the following will cause supabase to upsert data into the `users` table.
          If the username 'supabot' already exists, the `onConflict` argument tells supabase to overwrite that row
          based on the column passed into `onConflict`.

  - id: delete
    description: |
      Perform a DELETE on the table or view.
    title: 'Delete data: delete()'
    notes: |
      - `delete()` should always be combined with [Filters](/docs/reference/dart/using-filters) to target the item(s) you wish to delete.
      - If you use `delete()` with filters and you have RLS enabled, only rows visible through `SELECT` policies are deleted. Note that by default no rows are visible, so you need at least one `SELECT`/`ALL` policy that makes the rows visible.
    examples:
      - id: delete-records
        name: Delete records
        isSpotlight: true
        code: |
          ```dart

      You can call stored procedures as a "Remote Procedure Call".

      That's a fancy way of saying that you can put some logic into your database then call it from anywhere.

    title: 'removeChannel()'
    notes: |
      - Removing a channel is a great way to maintain the performance of your project's Realtime service as well as your database if you're listening to Postgres changes. Supabase will automatically handle cleanup 30 seconds after a client is disconnected, but unused channels may cause degradation as more clients are simultaneously subscribed.

      Returns real-time data from your table as a `Stream`.
    title: 'stream()'
    notes: |
      - Realtime is disabled by default for new tables. You can turn it on by [managing replication](/docs/guides/realtime/postgres-changes#replication-setup).
      - `stream()` will emit the initial data as well as any further change on the database as `Stream<List<Map<String, dynamic>>>` by combining Postgrest and Realtime.
      - Takes a list of primary key column names that will be used to update and delete the proper records within the SDK.
      - The following filters are available
        - `.eq('column', value)` listens to rows where the column equals the value
        - `.neq('column', value)` listens to rows where the column does not equal the value
        - `.gt('column', value)` listens to rows where the column is greater than the value
        - `.gte('column', value)` listens to rows where the column is greater than or equal to the value
        - `.lt('column', value)` listens to rows where the column is less than the value
        - `.lte('column', value)` listens to rows where the column is less than or equal to the value
        - `.inFilter('column', [val1, val2, val3])` listens to rows where the column is one of the values

    title: Using Modifiers
    description: |
      Filters work on the row level—they allow you to return rows that
      only match certain conditions without changing the shape of the rows.
      Modifiers are everything that don't fit that definition—allowing you to
      change the format of the response (e.g., returning a CSV string).

      Modifiers must be specified after filters. Some modifiers only apply for
      queries that return rows (e.g., `select()` or `rpc()` on a function that
      returns a table response).

    notes: |
      - `.or()` expects you to use the raw [PostgREST syntax](https://postgrest.org/en/stable/api.html#horizontal-filtering-rows) for the filter names and values.

        ```dart
        .or('id.in.(6,7),arraycol.cs.{"a","b"}')  // Use Postgres list () and 'in' for in_ filter. Array {} and 'cs' for contains.
        .or('id.in.(${mylist.join(',')}),arraycol.cs.{${mylistArray.join(',')}}')	// You can insert a Dart list for list or array column.
        .or('id.in.(${mylist.join(',')}),rangecol.cs.(${mylistRange.join(',')}]')	// You can insert a Dart list for list or range column.

  - id: not
    title: not()
    description: |
      Finds all rows which doesn't satisfy the filter.
    notes: |
      - `.not()` expects you to use the raw [PostgREST syntax](https://postgrest.org/en/stable/api.html#horizontal-filtering-rows) for the filter names and values.

        ```dart
        .not('name','eq','Paris')
        .not('arraycol','cs','{"a","b"}') // Use Postgres array {} for array column and 'cs' for contains.
        .not('rangecol','cs','(1,2]') // Use Postgres range syntax for range column.
        .not('id','in','(6,7)')  // Use Postgres list () and 'in' for in_ filter.
        .not('id','in','(${mylist.join(',')})')  // You can insert a Dart list array.

          Uses PostgreSQL's `websearch_to_tsquery` function.
          This function will never raise syntax errors, which makes it possible to use raw user-supplied input for search, and can be used
          with advanced operators.

          - `unquoted text`: text not inside quote marks will be converted to terms separated by & operators, as if processed by plainto_tsquery.
          - `"quoted text"`: text inside quote marks will be converted to terms separated by `<->` operators, as if processed by phraseto_tsquery.
          - `OR`: the word “or” will be converted to the | operator.
          - `-`: a dash will be converted to the ! operator.

        code: |
          ```dart
          final data = await supabase
            .from('quotes')
            .select('catchphrase')

    title: filter()
    description: |
      Finds all rows whose `column` satisfies the filter.
    notes: |
      - `.filter()` expects you to use the raw [PostgREST syntax](https://postgrest.org/en/stable/api.html#horizontal-filtering-rows) for the filter names and values, so it should only be used as an escape hatch in case other filters don't work.
        ```dart
          .filter('arraycol','cs','{"a","b"}') // Use Postgres array {} and 'cs' for contains.
          .filter('rangecol','cs','(1,2]') // Use Postgres range syntax for range column.
          .filter('id','in','(6,7)')  // Use Postgres list () and 'in' for in_ filter.
          .filter('id','cs','{${mylist.join(',')}}')  // You can insert a Dart array list.
