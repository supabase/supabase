This cooldown period isn't a Supabase limitation. It's rooted in how Amazon EBS (the underlying storage instance for our databases) manages volume modifications. After modifying a volume (e.g. increasing size, changing type, or IOPS), AWS enforces a mandatory 6-hour cooldown before allowing another modification on the same volume. This is to ensure data integrity and stability of the volume under load.

From the [**AWS docs**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_ModifyVolume.html):

> “After modifying a volume, you must wait at least six hours and ensure that the volume is in the in-use or available state before you can modify the same volume. This is sometimes referred to as a cooldown period.”

There are a few options to work around the cooldown, depending on the state of your database:

1.  **Restore to a new project**: This spins up a new instance with a new disk, bypassing the cooldown entirely. It’s a great option if you're okay with a new project and project refactoring. [**Docs: restoring to a new project**](/docs/guides/platform/backups#restore-to-a-new-project).
2.  **pg_upgrade**: Our [**pg_upgrade**](/docs/guides/platform/upgrading) implementation migrates your data to a new disk, which skips the cooldown. The main requirement here is that the database must be operational - it can't run it if your DB is in a degraded or inaccessible state.
3.  **Pause and Restore**: This also migrates to a new disk but is only available for projects on the Free plan. If you're not on the Free plan, you'd need to [**transfer your project to an organization on the Free plan**](/docs/guides/platform/project-transfer) first.

If the database is down or locked in a bad state (e.g corrupted or stuck during resize), the only path forward is to wait until the cooldown expires and the disk resize job completes in the queue.
