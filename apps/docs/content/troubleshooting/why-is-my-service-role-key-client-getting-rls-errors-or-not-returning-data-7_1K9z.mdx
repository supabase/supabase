A Supabase client with the Authorization header set to the service role apikey will ALWAYS bypass RLS. By default the Authorization header is the apikey used in createClient. If you are getting an RLS error then you have a user session getting into the client or you initialized with the anon key. RLS in enforced based on the Authorization header and not the apikey header.

Three common cases of the createClient apikey being replaced by a user session/token:

1. SSR client initialized with service role. The SSR clients are designed to share the user session from cookies. The user session will override the default apikey from createClient in the Authorization header. If you are using SSR, always create a separate server client using supabase-js directly for service role.

2. Edge functions or other server code setting the Authorization header in createClient options directly to a user token/jwt. When you set the Authorization header directly that overrides the default action of using the apikey for the Authorization header.

3. Server client initialized with service role using signUp to create a user or other auth functions. Many auth functions will return a user session to the client making the call. When that happens the apikey will be replaced by the user token/jwt in the Authorization header. If you are wanting to create a user in a service role client use admin.createUser() instead. Otherwise use a separate Supabase client for for service role from other actions.

Also note that adding service_role in RLS policies does nothing. Service role will never run the policies to begin with.
