If your Supabase account was initiated via the Vercel Marketplace, you will not be able to log in directly using email/password or reset your password. This is because such accounts are tightly coupled to Vercel's authentication system, restricting login to Vercel's integrated methods.

To access your Supabase account independently of the Vercel Marketplace, you can use GitHub OAuth as an alternative:

1.  Ensure the GitHub account you use has the same email address associated with your Vercel Marketplace Supabase account.
2.  Navigate to the [Supabase dashboard sign-in page](/dashboard/sign-in).
3.  Select "Continue with GitHub" and complete the authentication process.

This method provides direct access to your Supabase dashboard, organizations, and projects without requiring login through the Vercel Marketplace.
