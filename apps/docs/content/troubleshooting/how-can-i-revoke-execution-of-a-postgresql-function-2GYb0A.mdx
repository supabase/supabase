All functions access is PUBLIC by default, this means that any role can execute it. To revoke execution, there are 2 steps required:

- Revoke function execution (`foo` in this case) from PUBLIC:

```sql
revoke execute on function foo from public;
```

- Revoke execution from a particular role (`anon` in this case):

```sql
revoke execute on function foo from anon;
```

Now `anon` should get an error when trying to execute the function:

```sql
begin;
set local role anon;
select foo();
ERROR:  permission denied for function foo
```
