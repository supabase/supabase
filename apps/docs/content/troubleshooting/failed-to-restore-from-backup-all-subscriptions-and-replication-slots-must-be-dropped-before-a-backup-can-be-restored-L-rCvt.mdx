As the error suggests, you must first drop any current subscriptions or replication slots to restore backups.

You can check those with:

```
SELECT * FROM pg_replication_slots;

SELECT * FROM pg_subscription;
```

You can drop them with:

```
DROP SUBSCRIPTION <subscription>;

SELECT pg_drop_replication_slot(slot_name);
```

NOTE: These are destructive actions. This is fine since you will overwrite your database with a backup.
