### TL;DR: Basic summary

Row-Level Security (RLS) Policy: A `WHERE` or `CHECK` condition applied automatically to database queries

Key features:

- Applies without being explicitly added to each query, which makes it good for policing row access from unknown entities, such as those leveraging the anon or authenticated roles.
- Can be set for specific actions (e.g., SELECT, INSERT)
- Can target particular database roles (e.g., "anon", "authenticated")

Contrast with regular conditions:

- Regular conditions: Apply to all roles and must be added manually to each query
- RLS policies: Applied automatically to specified actions and roles

## Hands on walk-through for conditions

### USING:

The `USING` keyword inspects the value of row to see if it should be made visible to the query.

When you SELECT, UPDATE, or DELETE, you have to use a WHERE statement to search for specific rows:

```sql
-- select
select *
from some_table
where id = 5;

-- update
update some_table
set id = 6
where id = 5;

-- delete
delete from some_table
where id = 6;
```

Even when you don't use a WHERE statement, there's still an implicit one:

```sql
-- ...your query
WHERE true;
```

The `USING` clause appends more to the WHERE statement:

```sql
-- Your Using condition
USING (
  (select auth.uid()) = user_id
);

-- Your query without RLS:
SELECT * FROM some_table
WHERE id = 5 OR id = 6;

-- Your query after RLS
SELECT * FROM some_table
WHERE
  (id = 5 OR id = 6)
    AND
  (select auth.uid()) = user_id) -- <--- added by the USING clause;
```

### WITH CHECK:

Let's say you have a profile table. Well, you don't want user's to be able to modify their user_id when they make an insert, do you?

The `WITH CHECK` condition inspects values that are being added or modified. For INSERT you'd use it by itself. There's no need for a using clause:

```sql
-- Allow users to add to table, but make sure their user_id matches the one in their JWT:

create policy "Allow user to add posts"
on "public"."posts"
as PERMISSIVE
for INSERT
to authenticated
with check(
  (select auth.uid()) = user_id
);

-- Example: failing insert
INSERT INTO posts
VALUES (<false id>, <comment>);

-- Example: successful insert
INSERT INTO posts
VALUES (<real id>, <comment>);
```

INSERTs do not rely on WHERE clauses, but they can have constraints. In this case, the RLS acts as a CHECK constraint against a column, e.g.:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD CONSTRAINT constraint_name CHECK (condition);
```

What distinguishes it from normal `CHECK` constraints is that it is only activate for certain roles or methods.

### UPDATEs:

UPDATE both filters for rows to change and then adds new values to the table, so it requires both USING and WITH CHECK conditions:

```sql
create policy "Allow user to edit their stuff"
on "public"."<SOME TABLE NAME>"
as RESTRICTIVE
for UPDATE
to authenticated
using (
  (select auth.uid()) = user_id
)
with check(
  (select auth.uid()) = user_id
);
```
