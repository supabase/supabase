If you're not able to connect to the Supabase database and see the error `connect ECONNREFUSED 1.2.3.4:5432` or `psql: error: connection to server at "db.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.supabase.co" (1.2.3.4), port 5432 failed: Connection refused
Is the server running on that host and accepting TCP/IP connections?`, this could be because there are banned IPs on your project caused by Fail2ban as it kicks in when attempting 2 wrong passwords in a row.

These bans will clear after 30mins but you can unban the IPs using the Supabase CLI https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli following the commands below.

## Unban IPs using the Dashboard

Go to [Database Settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/database/settings#banned-ips) and click **Unban IP**.

## Unban IPs using the CLI

How to list the banned IPs:

```
% supabase network-bans get --project-ref <project_reference_id> --experimental
```

How to unban the IPs:

```
% supabase network-bans remove --db-unban-ip <ip_address> --project-ref <project_reference_id> --experimental
```
