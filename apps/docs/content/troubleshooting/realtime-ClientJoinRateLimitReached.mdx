The error `ClientJoinRateLimitReached` means that your clients (app users) are joining channels faster than your plan allows.

Refer to [Realtime Quotas](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime/quotas):

| Plan                   | Joins/sec |
|------------------------|-----------|
| Free                   | 100       |
| Pro                    | 500       |
| Pro (no [spend cap](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/cost-control#configure-the-spend-cap))     | 2,500     |
| Team                   | 2,500     |
| Enterprise             | 2,500+    |


### Example:
On the Free plan (100 joins/sec), if 101 clients join your channels simultaneously, the 101st gets ClientJoinRateLimitReached. The remaining client will be able to retry after 1 second.

### How to fix it

Upgrade your plan to allow more joins per second or pace the rate that individual users can join channels.
