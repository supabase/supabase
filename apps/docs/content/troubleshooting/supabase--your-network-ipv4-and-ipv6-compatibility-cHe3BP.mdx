# Network compatibility with your Supabase database

The internet uses a system called the Internet Protocol (IP) to route communication between devices. There are two main versions:

- **IPv4**: Introduced in 1980, it's the original version.
- **IPv6**: Launched in 1999, it offers a much larger address space and is the preferred future-proof option.

### Supabase and IPv6:

All Supabase databases provide a direct connection string that maps to an IPv6 address.

### Working with IPv6 incompatible hosts:

Here are your options if your server platform doesn't support IPv6:

- Use the Supavisor Connection String (available in the [Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/database/settings)).
- Use the [Supabase Client libraries](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/api/rest/client-libs), which are IPv4 compatible.
- Enable the [dedicated IPv4 Add-On](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/addons) (available to Pro and above organizations)

> Note: the IPv4 Add-On costs <Price price="0.0055" /> an hour, which equates to ~<Price price="4.00" /> if left on for a full month (~720 hours)

### Checking IPv6 support:

The majority of services are IPv6 compatible. However, there are a few prominent ones that only accept IPv4 connections:

- [Retool](https://retool.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)
- [Render](https://render.com/)

If you're still unsure if your network supports IPv6, you can run this cURL command on your deployment server:

```sh
curl -6 https://ifconfig.co/ip
```

If the command returns an IPv6 address, the network is IPv6 compatible.

### Finding your database's IP address:

To determine your current IP address, you can use an IP address [lookup website](https://whatismyipaddress.com/hostname-ip) or the terminal command:

```sh
nslookup db.<PROJECT_REF>.supabase.co
```

This command queries the domain name servers to find the IP address of the given hostname.

Example IPv6 Address: `2a05:d014:1c06:5f0c:d7a9:8616:bee2:30df`

### Identifying your connections:

The pooler and direct connection strings can be found on the dashboard by clicking [Connect](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_?showConnect=true).

> "Note uses an IPv6 address by default

```sh
# Example connection string
postgresql://postgres:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@db.ajrbwkcuthywfihaarmflo.supabase.co:5432/postgres
```

#### Supavisor in transaction mode (port 6543)

```sh
# Example transaction string
postgresql://postgres.ajrbwkcuthywddfihrmflo:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres
```

#### Supavisor in session mode (port 5432)

```sh
# Example session string
postgresql://postgres.ajrbwkcuthywfddihrmflo:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres
```
