If you're having trouble deploying an Edge Function, follow these steps to diagnose and resolve the issue.

## Diagnose the issue

1. **Check function syntax:** Run `deno check` on your function files locally
2. **Review dependencies:** Verify all imports are accessible and compatible with Deno
3. **Examine bundle size:** Large functions may fail to deploy

```bash
# Check for syntax errors
deno check ./supabase/functions/your-function/index.ts

# Deploy with verbose output
supabase functions deploy your-function --debug
```

## Common causes

- **Syntax errors:** TypeScript or JavaScript syntax issues in your function code
- **Invalid imports:** Importing modules that don't exist or aren't compatible with Deno
- **Large bundle size:** Functions have a 10MB source code limit. See [Bundle size issues](./edge-function-bundle-size-issues) for more details
- **Network issues:** Problems reaching the Supabase API during deployment

## Before opening a support ticket

Make sure you're using the latest version of the Supabase CLI:

```bash
supabase --version
supabase update
```

If these steps don't resolve the issue, open a support ticket via the Supabase Dashboard and include all output from the diagnostic commands.
