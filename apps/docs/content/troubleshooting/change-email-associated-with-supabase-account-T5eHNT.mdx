If you are using Email Authentication to login into your Supabase account:

Go to [**Account Settings > Preferences**](/dashboard/account/me)

- Find your email under **Account Identities** and click the edit icon
- After saving the new address, an email is sent to _both the old and new email addresses_
- Your account email is updated after clicking the link _in both emails_
- Ensure the new address is shown by default in **Primary email**.
- If it is not, select it from the dropdown and save.

If you are using GitHub Authentication / [Vercel Marketplace](/docs/guides/integrations/vercel-marketplace) to login into your Supabase account:

- Log out of Supabase.
- Change Primary Email in GitHub / Vercel
- Log out of GitHub / Vercel.
- Log back into GitHub / Vercel (with the new, desired email set as primary)
- Log back into Supabase.
- Go to [**Account Settings > Preferences**](/dashboard/account/me)
- Ensure the new address is shown by default in **Primary email**.
- If it is not, select it from the dropdown and save.

**Note:**

- The email in the primary email value can only be linked to a single Supabase account.
- If you have multiple accounts using the same email, the first account associated with email will be have it assigned as the primary email. If you need to switch it, use the steps above to change the email on the account that you do not wish to associate the email with. Alternatively, if it is possible, [request for an account deletion](/dashboard/account/me) on the account so that it will remove the association. After that, go into the desired account and update **Primary email**.
