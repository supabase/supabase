If you are using Email Authentication to login into your Supabase account:

Go to [**Account Settings > Preferences**](/dashboard/account/me)

- Find your email under **Account Identities** and click the edit icon
- After saving the new address, an email is sent to _both the old and new email addresses_
- Your account email is updated after clicking the link _in both emails_

If you are using GitHub Authentication to login into your Supabase account:

- Log out of Supabase.
- Change Primary Email in GitHub
- Log out of GitHub.
- Log back into GitHub (with the new, desired email set as primary)
- Log back into Supabase.
