**Solution**
In cases where operations are overly complex or not feasible to implement directly using the client libraries, it might be beneficial to leverage stored functions within your database.

Follow these steps to create and run a stored function:

**Create the Stored Function:**

Go to the [SQL query editor](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/sql/new) on your database dashboard.
Run the following SQL script to create a stored function tailored to your specific complex query:

```
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS get_my_complex_query;
CREATE FUNCTION get_my_complex_query(parameter INT)
RETURNS TABLE (column1 INTEGER, column2 VARCHAR, column3 DATE) AS
$$
BEGIN
    RETURN QUERY
    SELECT t1.column1, t1.column2, t2.column3
    FROM "TableName1" AS t1
    INNER JOIN "TableName2" AS t2 ON t1.column = t2.column
    INNER JOIN "TableName3" AS t3 ON t2.another_column = t3.another_column
    LEFT JOIN "TableName4" AS t4 ON t3.some_column = t4.some_column
    WHERE t2.column = parameter
    AND t3.column_name = 'some_value';
END;
$$
LANGUAGE plpgsql VOLATILE;
```

**Call the Stored Function:**

Use the supabase.rpc method to call the stored function from your application code. Replace "get_my_complex_query" with the appropriate function name and provide the necessary parameters:

```
supabase.rpc("get_my_complex_query", { parameter: 1 })
  .then(response => {
    // Handle the response
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // Handle errors
  });
```
