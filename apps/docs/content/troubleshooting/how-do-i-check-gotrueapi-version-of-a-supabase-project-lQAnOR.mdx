Make a `GET` request to the health check endpoint to retrieve this information. Below is an example using `curl`:

```
curl -X GET 'https://project-ref.supabase.co/auth/v1/health' -H 'apikey: ANON_KEY'

{
    "version": "v2.60.7",
    "name": "GoTrue",
    "description": "GoTrue is a user registration and authentication API"
}
```
