# Navigating the API logs:

The Database API is powered by a [ PostgREST web-server](https://postgrest.org/en/v12/), recording every request to the API Edge Network logs. To precisely navigate them, use the [Log Explorer](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/logs/explorer). These logs are managed through [Logflare](https://supabase.com/blog/supabase-logs-self-hosted) and can be queried with a subset of BigQuery SQL syntax.

The log table that contains API requests is `edge_logs`.

Notably, it contains:
| field | description |
--------|-------------|
| event_message | the log's message |
| timestamp | time event was recorded |
| request metadata | metadata about the REST request |
| response metadata | metadata about the REST response |

The request and response columns are arrays in the metadata field and must be unnested. This is done with a `cross join`.

**Unnesting example**

```sql
select
  -- the event message does not require unnesting
  event_message,
  -- unnested status_code column from metadata.response field
  status_code
from
  edge_logs
  -- Unpack data stored in the 'metadata' field
  cross join unnest(metadata) as metadata
  -- After unpacking the 'metadata' field, extract the 'response' field from it
  cross join unnest(response) as response;
```

The most useful fields for debugging are:

## Request object

### Cloudflare geographic data:

**Suggested use cases:**

- Detecting abuse from a specific region
- Detecting activity spikes from certain regions

| Column               | Description           | Sample value                                          |
| -------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| request.cf.city      | Requester's city      | Munich                                                |
| request.cf.country   | Requester's country   | [DE](https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html) |
| request.cf.continent | Requester's continent | EU                                                    |
| request.cf.region    | Requester's region    | Bavaria                                               |
| request.cf.latitudex | Requester's latitude  | 48.10840                                              |
| request.cf.longitude | Requester's longitude | 11.61020                                              |
| request.cf.timezone  | Requester's timezone  | Europe/Berlin                                         |

**Unnesting example:**

```sql
select
  city
from
  edge_logs
-- Unpack 'metadata' field
cross join unnest(metadata) AS metadata
-- unpack 'request' from 'metadata'
cross join unnest(request) AS request;
-- unpack 'cf' from 'request'
cross join unnest(cf) AS cf;
```

### IP and browser/environment data:

**Suggested use cases:**

- Detecting request behavior from IP
- Detecting abuse by IP
- Detecting errors by user_agent

| Column                           | Description                            | Sample value                                                                                                    |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| request.headers.cf_connecting_ip | Requester's IP                         | 80.81.18.138                                                                                                    |
| request.headers.user_agent       | Requester's browser or app environment | Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 11; K) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/123.0.0.0 Mobile Safari/537.36 |

**Unnesting example:**

```sql
select
  cf_connecting_ip
from
  edge_logs
-- Unpack 'metadata' field
cross join unnest(metadata) AS metadata
-- unpack 'request' from 'metadata'
cross join unnest(request) AS request;
-- unpack 'headers' from 'request'
cross join unnest(headers) AS headers;
```

### Query type and formatting data:

**Suggested use cases:**

- identify problematic queries
- identify unusual behavior by authenticated users

| Column                | Description                                               | Sample value                                                                                                              |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| request.method        | Request Method (PATCH, GET, PUT...)                       | GET                                                                                                                       |
| request.url           | Request URL, which contains the PostgREST formatted query | https://yuhplfrsdxxxtldakizi.supabase.co/rest/v1/users?select=username&id=eq.63b6190e-214f-4b8a-b72d-3af6e1921411&limit=1 |
| request.sb.auth_users | authenticated user's ID                                   | 63b6190e-214f-4b8a-b72d-3af6e1921411                                                                                      |

**Unnesting example:**

```sql
select
  method,
  url,
  auth_users
from
  edge_logs
-- Unpack 'metadata' field
cross join unnest(metadata) AS metadata
-- unpack 'request' from 'metadata'
cross join unnest(request) AS request;
-- unpack 'sb' from 'request'
cross join unnest(sb) AS sb;
```

## Response object

### Status code:

**Suggested use cases:**

- detect success/errors

| Column               | Description                             | Sample value |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| response.status_code | Response status code (200, 404, 500...) | 404          |

**Unnesting example:**

```sql
select
  status_code
from
  edge_logs
  -- Unpack 'metadata' field
  cross join unnest(metadata) as metadata
  -- unpack 'response' from 'metadata'
  cross join unnest(response) as response;
```

# Finding errors

### API level errors

The `metadata.request.url` contains PostgREST formatted queries.

For example, the following call to the JS client:

```js
let { data: countries, error } = await supabase.from('countries').select('name')
```

translates to calling the following endpoint:

```bash
https://<project ref>.supabase.co/rest/v1/countries?select=name
```

You can use regex ([Advanced Regex Guide](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/22640)) to find the objects related to your query. Try isolating by:

- function names
- column names
- table names
- query methods (select, insert, ...)

Example:

```sql
select
  cast(timestamp as datetime) as timestamp,
  status_code,
  url,
  event_message
from edge_logs
cross join unnest(metadata) as metadata
cross join unnest(response) AS request;
cross join unnest(response) AS response;
where
  -- find all errors
  status_code >= 400
    and
  -- find queries featuring the a specific <table_name> and <column_name>
  (
    regexp_contains(url, '<table_name>')
    and
    regexp_contains(event_message, '<column_name1>|<column_name2>')
  )
```

PostgREST has an [error reference table](https://postgrest.org/en/v12/references/errors.html) that you can use to interpret status codes.

### Database-level errors

However, some errors that are reported through the Database API occur at the PostgreSQL level. If it is not clear which error occurred you should reference the timestamp of the error and try to see if you can find it in the Postgres logs.

```sql
select
  cast(postgres_logs.timestamp as datetime) as timestamp,
  error_severity,
  user_name,
  query,
  detail,
  sql_state_code,
  event_message
from postgres_logs
  cross join unnest(metadata) as metadata
  cross join unnest(metadata.parsed) as parsed
where
  -- filter only for error events
  regexp_contains(parsed.error_severity, 'ERROR|FATAL|PANIC')
    and
  -- All DB API requests are registered as the authenticator role
  parsed.user_name = 'authenticator'
    and
  -- find failed queries featuring the function <function_name>
  regexp_contains(parsed.query, '<function_name>')
    and
  -- limit the time of the search to be around the time of the failed API request
postgres_logs.timestamp between '2024-04-15 10:50:00' AND '2024-04-15 10:50:27'
order by
 timestamp desc
limit 100;
```

Like PostgREST, PostgreSQL has a [reference table](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/errcodes-appendix.html) for interpreting error codes.

## PostgREST server and Cloudflare errors

In some cases, errors may emerge because of Cloudflare or PostgREST server errors. For 500 and above errors, you may want to check your [PostgREST](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/logs/postgrest-logs) logs and the [Cloudflare docs.](https://developers.cloudflare.com/support/troubleshooting/cloudflare-errors/troubleshooting-cloudflare-5xx-errors/#error-502-bad-gateway-or-error-504-gateway-timeout))

# Practical examples:

**Find All Errors:**

```sql
select
  cast(timestamp as datetime) as timestamp,
  status_code,
  event_message,
  path
from
  edge_logs
  cross join unnest(metadata) as metadata
  cross join unnest(response) as response
  cross join unnest(request) as request
where
  -- find all errors
  status_code >= 400
  and regexp_contains(path, '^/rest/v1/');
-- only look at DB API
```

**Group errors by path and code:**

```sql
select
  status_code,
  path,
  count(path) as reoccurrence_per_path
from
  edge_logs
  cross join unnest(metadata) as metadata
  cross join unnest(response) as response
  cross join unnest(request) as request
where
  -- find all errors
  status_code >= 400
  and regexp_contains(path, '^/rest/v1/') -- only look at DB API
group by path, status_code
order by reoccurrence_per_path;
```

**Find requests by region:**

```sql
select
  path,
  region,
  count(region) as region_count
from
  edge_logs
  cross join unnest(metadata) as metadata
  cross join unnest(request) as request
  cross join unnest(cf) as cf
where
  -- only look at DB API
  regexp_contains(path, '^/rest/v1/')
group by region, path
order by requester_region_count;
```

**Find total requests by IP:**

```sql
select
  cf_connecting_ip as ip,
  count(cf_connecting_ip) as ip_count
from
  edge_logs
  cross join unnest(metadata) as metadata
  cross join unnest(request) as request
  cross join unnest(headers) as headers
  cross join unnest(cf) as cf
  cross join unnest(response) as response
where regexp_contains(path, '^/auth/v1/')
group by ip
order by ip_count;
```

**Search frequented query paths by authenticated user:**

```sql
select
  -- only available for front-end clients
  auth_users,
  path,
  count(auth_users) as ip_count
from
  edge_logs
  cross join unnest(metadata) as metadata
  cross join unnest(request) as request
  cross join unnest(sb) as sb
where
  -- only look at DB API
  regexp_contains(path, '^/rest/v1/')
group by auth_users, path;
```
