You can view the max permissible upload size for your plan in the [docs](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage/uploads/file-limits).

## There are two ways to control the max upload sizes:

The first way is through the [global storage settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/storage):

/>

The second way is at the [bucket level](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/storage/buckets/)

1. Edit a bucket's configurations:

   />

2. Change the file upload restriction if set:

   />

## Different upload methods impose file size restrictions:

- [Standard uploads can only transfer up to 5GBs](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage/uploads/standard-uploads?queryGroups=language&language=js). However, for files above 6MB, the below methods are more performant and reliable
- [Resumable](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage/uploads/resumable-uploads) and [S3](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage/uploads/resumable-uploads) uploads can support transfers up to 50GB in size.
