You can view the maximum file upload size from the [docs](/docs/guides/storage/uploads/file-limits). It differs based on your plan and on any bucket or global limits you might have already set.

## Edit the maximum file upload size

There are two ways to edit the maximum file upload size:

- Global file upload size limit
- Bucket-level file upload size limit

### Global file upload size limit

To edit the global file upload size limit, change the value of _Global file size limit_ in the top section of [Storage Settings](/dashboard/project/_/storage/settings).

If they are set higher than your new global limit, you’ll be asked to edit or remove any existing bucket-level limits first. The global limit takes precedence.

### Bucket-level file upload size limit

Follow these steps to edit the maximum file upload size at the bucket level:

1. Open a bucket in the [Storage Buckets](/dashboard/project/_/storage/buckets/) page.
2. Select the overflow menu (three vertical dots icon), and then select _Edit bucket_.
3. Enable _Restrict file size_ and then set the file size limit for that bucket.

You won’t be able to set a limit that is greater than the global file upload size limit, as that takes precedence.

## File size restrictions

Upload methods impose differing file size restrictions:

- [Standard uploads can only transfer up to 5 GBs](/docs/guides/storage/uploads/standard-uploads?queryGroups=language&language=js). However, for files above 6MB, the below methods are more performant and reliable.
- [Resumable](/docs/guides/storage/uploads/resumable-uploads) and [S3](/docs/guides/storage/uploads/resumable-uploads) uploads can support transfers up to 50GB in size.
