Authentication is hard. SSR is harder. At Supabase, we try to address these together by providing`@supabase/ssr` package to help implement authentication with Supabase conveniently. While I’m targeting to address Next.js-related issues, you can probably apply these concepts to other SSR frameworks such as Nuxt, SvelteKit, and Remix. This is a living document, and we plan to update it regularly as Next.js and its APIs + `@supabase/ssr` evolve.

If you are experiencing issues with Supabase Auth and SSR, the following checklist will help you troubleshoot the issues.

✅ You’re on the latest version of `@supabase/ssr` package. Note that the `@supabase/auth-helpers` package is being deprecated, and all the bug fixes and feature releases will be focused on the `@supabase/ssr` package.
✅ Do you have all the client utility functions implemented? This way, you can easily import them into your components that need access to Supabase auth functions. Make sure to follow the [guide available here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/server-side/creating-a-client?queryGroups=framework&framework=nextjs&queryGroups=environment&environment=client-component#creating-a-client) carefully to avoid running into unexpected errors.
✅ Do you have the `middleware.ts` file correctly implemented? This lets you refresh expired sessions before loading server components that require a user session for authorization.

This documentation will help you validate that you’re on the correct path.

Another way to identify any potential issues with your code is to compare it with the Supabase Next.js quickstart. Use the command `npx create-next-app -e with-supabase` to download a copy to your local machine of the quickstart application.

Our YouTube channel has great videos to help you implement Supabase Auth with Next.js.
