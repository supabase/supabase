If your Supabase project, provisioned through Bolt's Claude Agent, isn't appearing in your Supabase dashboard, it indicates an ownership difference.

## Why does this happen?

By default, Bolt agent uses Bolt Cloud Backend. When a Cloud backend is created, the Supabase project linked to the backend is owned by Bolt's organizational account. This means they won't automatically show in your personal Supabase dashboard.

## How to resolve this issue

To gain access and manage this database within your personal Supabase account, you must perform a database claim action. Refer to Bolt's official documentation for the precise procedure: [Claim Your Bolt Database in Supabase](https://support.bolt.new/integrations/supabase#claim-your-bolt-database-in-supabase).
