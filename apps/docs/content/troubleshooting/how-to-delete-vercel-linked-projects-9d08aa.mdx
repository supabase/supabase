When you create Supabase projects through the Vercel Marketplace, complete deletion requires action on both platforms.

## Deleting projects

### Method 1: Delete from Supabase first, then clean up in Vercel

This method requires two steps - first delete in Supabase, then clean up in Vercel.

1. **Delete from Supabase Dashboard**

   Go to your [project settings](/dashboard/project/_/settings/general) and click **"Delete project"**. This permanently removes your database and marks it as "uninstalled" in Vercel.

2. **Clean up in Vercel**

   After deleting from Supabase, clean up in Vercel:

   - Navigate to your [Vercel dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
   - Go to the **Storage** tab
   - Click on the Supabase project (it will show as "uninstalled")

   />

   - Scroll down and find the **Settings** tab in the sidebar

   />

   - Click **Delete Database** to completely remove it

### Method 2: Delete directly from Vercel (removes from both platforms)

This method deletes the project from both Vercel and Supabase in one action.

1. **Open Vercel dashboard**

   Navigate to your [Vercel dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard) and go to the **Storage** tab.

2. **Select your project**

   Click on your Supabase project to open it.

3. **Navigate to Settings**

   Find and click the **Settings** tab in the sidebar.

   />

4. **Delete the project**

   Scroll down and click **Delete Database**. This removes the project from both Vercel and Supabase simultaneously.

## Transferring projects from Vercel organizations

<Admonition type="note">

**Important:** You cannot directly "unlink" a project from a Vercel organization. Instead, you need to transfer the project to another organization.

</Admonition>

If you want to move a Vercel-linked project to a different organization:

1. **Transfer the project**

   Go to your [project settings](/dashboard/project/_/settings/general) and look for **"Transfer Project"**. Transfer your project to a different organization.

   <Image

     zoomable
   />

   Note: The owner must be a member of both the source and target organizations. Transferring a Vercel-managed project will remove its linked Vercel storage from your team.

2. **Clean up in Vercel**

   After transferring, the project will show as "uninstalled" in Vercel but still appear under Storage. You need to manually delete it:

   - Navigate to your [Vercel dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
   - Go to the **Storage** tab
   - Click on the Supabase project (it will show as "uninstalled")
   - Go to **Settings** and click **Delete Database**

3. **Reconnect if needed**

   To reconnect the transferred project after the transfer, use the standard Vercel integration.

## Deleting the organization

<Admonition type="caution">

Delete all associated projects before deleting the organization.

</Admonition>

1. **Navigate to organization settings and delete**

   Go to your [organization settings](/dashboard/org/_/general) and click **"Delete organization in Vercel Marketplace"**. This opens the Vercel settings page.

   />

2. **Uninstall integration**

   Scroll down and click **Uninstall Integration** to fully remove the organization and disconnect it from Vercel.

   />

## Important notes

- Projects created through Vercel Marketplace can be deleted from either platform (Supabase or Vercel), with cleanup required on Vercel if deleting from Supabase first.
- Deletion permanently removes all project data.
- After uninstalling the integration, non-Vercel users invited to the organization retain their access.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Verify you have necessary permissions in both platforms
2. Refresh your browser and retry
3. Ensure all projects are deleted before deleting the organization
4. [Contact support](/dashboard/support/new) if problems persist
