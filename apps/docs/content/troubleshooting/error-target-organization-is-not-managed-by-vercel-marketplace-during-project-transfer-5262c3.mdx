If you encounter the error "Target organization is not managed by Vercel Marketplace (currently unsupported)" when attempting a project transfer, it indicates an attempt to move a project from a Supabase-managed organization to a Vercel Marketplace-managed organization. This transfer direction is currently not supported due to existing Vercel Marketplace API limitations.

**Supported Transfer Direction:**
Project transfers from a Vercel-managed organization to a Supabase-managed organization are supported. To perform this transfer:

1.  Create a new Supabase-managed organization via your [dashboard](/dashboard).
2.  From your project settings, initiate a transfer to the newly created Supabase-managed organization.
3.  If any errors occur, refresh the page and retry the transfer.
