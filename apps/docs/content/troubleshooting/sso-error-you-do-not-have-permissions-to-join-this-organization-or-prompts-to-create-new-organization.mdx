When attempting to log in via SSO, you may observe the message "You do not have permissions to join this organization" or be prompted to create a new organization.

**Why This Happens:**

Supabase treats email/password and SSO identities as distinct, even when the email addresses are identical. Existing memberships associated with email/password accounts are not automatically linked to a newly created SSO identity.

**How to Resolve This Issue:**

If you want your org members to auto-join:

1.  As an organization administrator, ensure "Join organization on signup" is enabled in your SSO configuration.
2.  Navigate to your organization's `Members` settings.
3.  Remove any existing email/password-based user accounts that are intended to transition to SSO.
4.  Instruct these users to log in via SSO; they will be automatically re-added to your organization with the default role if auto-join is active.

Alternatively, you can manually re-invite their Google SSO identity to the org, ask them to accept the invite while signed in via Google and once confirmed, remove their old email/password account.

**Best Practice When Setting up SSO:**

Maintain owner account with a password login as a break-glass backup.
