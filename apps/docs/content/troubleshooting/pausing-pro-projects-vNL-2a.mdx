Pro-Projects at the moment cannot paused. However, [You are allowed to have two free organizations](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/org-based-billing#mix-of-free-and-pro-plan-projects) that can support one active project each and an unlimited amount of paused ones.

If a project is under 500MB, you can [transfer it to be under a free organization](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/project-transfer). Afterward, you can initiate a pause.

Alternatively, you can download a [daily backup](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/database/backups/scheduled) of just your database for archiving. You can also manually download a .SQL file of your database and storage buckets by following this [guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/migrating-and-upgrading-projects#migrate-your-project).

You can also download your storage buckets with the [Supabase CLI:](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/getting-started?queryGroups=platform&platform=npx)

```sql
npx supabase login

# link to your project
npx supabase link

npx supabase init

# will download files to current folder
npx supabase storage cp -r ss://bucket . --experimental
```
