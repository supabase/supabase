Learn how to track your Edge Function's performance and identify potential resource issues.

## Accessing metrics

Track your function's performance through the dashboard:

1. Navigate to Edge Functions > [Your Function] > Metrics
2. Review CPU, memory, and execution time charts
3. Identify potential problems in resource consumption

## Key metrics to monitor

### CPU usage

High CPU usage indicates your function is performing intensive computations. Consider:

- Optimizing algorithms
- Caching computed results
- Moving heavy processing to background jobs

### Memory usage

Memory spikes can cause function failures. Watch for:

- Large datasets loaded into memory
- Accumulated objects that aren't garbage collected
- Large dependency bundles

### Execution time

Long execution times can lead to timeouts. Monitor for:

- Slow external API calls
- Inefficient database queries
- Complex computational operations

## Resource limits

Edge Functions have limited resources compared to traditional servers. Optimize for:

- **Memory efficiency:** Avoid loading large datasets into memory
- **CPU optimization:** Minimize complex computations
- **Execution time:** Keep functions under 60 seconds

## Best practices

### Use streaming for large data

Instead of loading entire files into memory, stream data:

```tsx
// Stream responses instead of buffering
return new Response(readableStream, {
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
})
```

### Process data in chunks

Break large operations into smaller batches:

```tsx
for (const batch of dataBatches) {
  await processBatch(batch)
}
```

### Cache expensive operations

Store results of expensive computations to avoid recalculating:

```tsx
const cachedResult = await cache.get(key)
if (cachedResult) {
  return cachedResult
}
```
