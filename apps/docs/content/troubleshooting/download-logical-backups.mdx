If you're unable to download backups due to physical backups being enabled, you can use the PostgreSQL utility `pg_dumpall` as an alternative. This tool offers more flexibility and control for creating backups.

You can use the command below to backup your database:
`pg_dumpall -h your-db-host.supabase.co -U postgres > backup.sql`

Or alternatively, you can create a backup of your Supabase database and store it in your repository by running the following script: https://github.com/mansueli/Supa-Backup

To retrieve your database connection details from the dashboard:

1. Go to your Dashboard.
2. Select your Project.
3. Navigate to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_?showConnect=true.
4. Or click the "Connect" icon in the dashboard.
5. There, youâ€™ll see the connection strings that we have available.
