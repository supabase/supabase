When Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) or physical backups are enabled, Supabase no longer generates the downloadable logical backup file (backup.gz). This is expected, as the backup pipeline switches entirely to physical backups. You can still download backups via the Supabase CLI command `pgdump`.

For step-by-step instructions, check out our guide: [Backup & Restore](/docs/guides/platform/migrating-within-supabase/backup-restore).

You can also learn more about how backups work in Supabase here: [Database Backups](/docs/guides/platform/backups).
