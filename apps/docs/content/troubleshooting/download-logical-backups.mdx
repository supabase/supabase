If you're unable to download backups due to physical backups being enabled, you can use the Supabase CLI command `pgdump` as an alternative.
For step-by-step instructions, check out our guide: [Backup & Restore](/docs/guides/platform/migrating-within-supabase/backup-restore).

You can also learn more about how backups work in Supabase here: [Database Backups](/docs/guides/platform/backups).
