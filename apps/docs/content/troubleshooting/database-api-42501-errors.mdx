[Postgres 42501 errors](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/errcodes-appendix.html), often reported by clients as 401 or 403 errors, imply the request lacked adequate privileges. They can be viewed in the [log explorer](/dashboard/project/_/logs/explorer?q=select%0A++++cast%28postgres_logs.timestamp+as+datetime%29+as+timestamp%2C%0A++++event_message%2C%0A++++parsed.error_severity%2C%0A++++parsed.user_name%2C%0A++++parsed.query%2C%0A++++parsed.detail%2C%0A++++parsed.hint%2C%0A++++parsed.sql_state_code%2C%0A++++parsed.backend_type%0Afrom%0A++++postgres_logs%0A++++cross+join+unnest%28metadata%29+as+metadata%0A++++cross+join+unnest%28metadata.parsed%29+as+parsed%0Awhere%0A++++parsed.sql_state_code+%3D+%2742501%27%0Aorder+by%0A++++timestamp+desc%0Alimit+100%3B%0A) by running:

```sql
select
  cast(postgres_logs.timestamp as datetime) as timestamp,
  event_message,
  parsed.error_severity,
  parsed.user_name,
  parsed.query,
  parsed.detail,
  parsed.hint
from
  postgres_logs
  cross join unnest(metadata) as metadata
  cross join unnest(metadata.parsed) as parsed
where
  regexp_contains(parsed.error_severity, 'ERROR|FATAL|PANIC')
  and parsed.sql_state_code = '42501'
order by timestamp desc
limit 100;
```

They tend to be caused by one of the following factors.

### Attempted to access a forbidden schema

API roles cannot access certain schemas, most notably `auth` and `vault`. This restriction extends to Foreign Data Wrappers relying on `vault`. While you can bypass it using a [security definer function](/docs/guides/database/functions?queryGroups=language&language=sql&queryGroups=example-view&example-view=sql#security-definer-vs-invoker), these schemas are intentionally restricted for security reasons.

### Attempted to access a custom schema

If you created a custom schema, you will have to give the Database API permission to query it. Follow our [Using Custom Schemas guide](/docs/guides/api/using-custom-schemas) for more directions.

### Revoked object level access:

In rare cases, users may accidentally revoke object-level access in `public` from their API roles. To regrant full visibility, run the below code:

```sql
grant usage on schema public to anon, authenticated, service_role;
grant all on all tables in schema public to anon, authenticated, service_role;
grant all on all routines in schema public to anon, authenticated, service_role;
grant all ON all sequences in schema public to anon, authenticated, service_role;
alter default privileges for role postgres in schema public grant all on tables to anon, authenticated, service_role;
alter default privileges for role postgres in schema public grant all on routines to anon, authenticated, service_role;
alter default privileges for role postgres in schema public grant all on sequences to anon, authenticated, service_role;
```

### Configured column-level restrictions

If you've set column-based access in the [Dashboard](/dashboard/project/_/database/column-privileges) or via SQL, queries will fail with a `42501` error when accessing restricted columns. This includes using `select *`, as it expands to include forbidden columns.

### RLS:

If the anon or authenticated roles attempt to UPDATE or INSERT values without the necessary RLS permissions, Postgres will return a 42501 error.
