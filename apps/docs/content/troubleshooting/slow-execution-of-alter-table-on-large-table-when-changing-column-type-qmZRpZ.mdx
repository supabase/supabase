If you encounter slow execution of the ALTER TABLE operation on a large table when changing a column data type, consider the following alternative approach.

**Alternative Approach:**

1. Add a New Column with the New Type:
   `ALTER TABLE "table_name" ADD COLUMN "new_column_name" new_data_type;`

2. Copy Values from the First Column to the Second:
   `UPDATE "table_name" SET "old_column_name" = "new_column_name"::new_data_type;`

3. Drop the Old Column:
   `ALTER TABLE "table_name" DROP COLUMN "old_column_name";`

**Why Use This Approach?**
The long execution time for the ALTER TABLE operation can be attributed to the large size of the table. This segmented approach helps in:

- Efficiency: The process is more efficient as it avoids prolonged transactions.
- Minimizing Disruption: Migrating data systematically minimizes the impact on other operations and users.

**Additional Recommendations:**

- Set session statement_timeout to 0 to prevent potential transaction [timeouts](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/postgres/configuration).

- Monitor currently blocked database transactions during the process using the provided script:

```
create view  public.lock_monitor as
select
  coalesce(
    blockingl.relation::regclass::text,
    blockingl.locktype
  ) as locked_item,
  now() - blockeda.query_start as waiting_duration,
  [blockeda.pid](http://blockeda.pid/) as blocked_pid,
  blockeda.query as blocked_query,
  blockedl.mode as blocked_mode,
  [blockinga.pid](http://blockinga.pid/) as blocking_pid,
  blockinga.query as blocking_query,
  blockingl.mode as blocking_mode
from
  pg_locks blockedl
  join pg_stat_activity blockeda on [blockedl.pid](http://blockedl.pid/) = [blockeda.pid](http://blockeda.pid/)
  join pg_locks blockingl on (
    blockingl.transactionid = blockedl.transactionid
    or blockingl.relation = blockedl.relation
    and blockingl.locktype = blockedl.locktype
  )
  and [blockedl.pid](http://blockedl.pid/) <> [blockingl.pid](http://blockingl.pid/)
  join pg_stat_activity blockinga on [blockingl.pid](http://blockingl.pid/) = [blockinga.pid](http://blockinga.pid/)
  and blockinga.datid = blockeda.datid
where
  not blockedl.granted
  and blockinga.datname = current_database();
```

**Notes:**
Execute these steps during a maintenance window or low-traffic period to minimize disruption.
