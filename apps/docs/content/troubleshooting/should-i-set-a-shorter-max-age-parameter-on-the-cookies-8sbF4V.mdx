The `Max-Age` or `Expires` cookie parameters only control whether the browser sends the value to the server. Since a refresh token represents the long-lived authentication session of the user on that browser, setting a short `Max-Age` or `Expires` parameter on the cookies only results in a degraded user experience.

The only way to ensure that a user has logged out or their session has ended is to get the user's details with `getUser()`.
