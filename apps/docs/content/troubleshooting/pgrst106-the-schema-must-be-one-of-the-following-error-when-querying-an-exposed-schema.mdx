You may encounter a `PGRST106` error, stating `{"code":"PGRST106","message":"The schema must be one of the following: public"}`, when attempting to query a schema via the PostgREST API that you've recently exposed.

**Why This Happens:**
This error occurs because the `authenticator` role's `pgrst.db_schemas` setting does not include the desired schema. This creates a conflict, as PostgREST relies on this setting to know which schemas it should expose.

**How to Resolve This:**
To fix this, you need to update the `pgrst.db_schemas` setting for the `authenticator` role. Connect to your database and execute one of the following SQL commands:

- **To explicitly add your schema:**
  If you want to add your specific schema (e.g., `your_schema_name`) alongside existing schemas (like `public`), use the following command. Remember to replace `your_schema_name` with your actual schema name and include all other necessary schemas already defined.
  `ALTER ROLE authenticator SET pgrst.db_schemas = 'public, your_schema_name';`

- **To reset to [dashboard configuration](/dashboard/project/_/settings/api):**
  Alternatively, you can reset this setting to allow the Supabase dashboard's configuration to take effect automatically.
  `ALTER ROLE authenticator RESET pgrst.db_schemas;`
