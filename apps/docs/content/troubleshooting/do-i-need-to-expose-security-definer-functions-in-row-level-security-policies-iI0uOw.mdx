PostgREST supports 2 config parameters:

- Exposed Schemas
- Extra Search Path

![image](/docs/img/troubleshooting/d756aeb0-515f-425d-b737-75a935935b73.png)

You do not need to add your "security definer" Functions to either of these if you are using them in your Policies.

PostgREST doesnâ€™t need to know about this function on extra search path or exposed schemas, as long as you explicitly use the schema inside RLS (eg: `security.rls_func`).
