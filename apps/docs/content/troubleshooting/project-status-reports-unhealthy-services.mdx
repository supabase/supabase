![Unhealthy services in Project Status](/docs/img/troubleshooting/project-status-unhealthy-services.png)

If the project was recently restored, it can take up a couple minutes to become fully operational.

Services rely on the backend database. Unhealthy services can indicate a database being overloaded due to being undersized or not tuned appropriately.

- Review this [troubleshooting doc](/docs/guides/troubleshooting/failed-to-run-sql-query-connection-terminated-due-to-connection-timeout) to determine if it could be a resource issue.
- If services recover and become unhealthy again, there is likely a repeated issue overloading the database.

Possible resolutions:

- Restart the database in [Project Settings](/dashboard/project/_/settings/general) (this may be only a temporary fix if the project is undersized / unoptimized).
- Increase project resources in [Compute and Disk](/dashboard/project/_/settings/compute-and-disk).
- [Performance Tune](/docs/guides/platform/performance) the database.
