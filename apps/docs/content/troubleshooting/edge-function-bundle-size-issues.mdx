Edge Functions have a 10MB source code limit. If your function exceeds this limit, deployment will fail.

## Check your bundle size

Use the `deno info` command to analyze your function's dependencies and total size:

```bash
deno info /path/to/function/index.ts
```

Look for the "size" field in the output to see the total bundle size.

## How to reduce bundle size

If your bundle is too large, try these strategies:

### Remove unused dependencies

Review your imports and remove any packages you're not actively using.

### Use selective imports

Instead of importing entire packages, import only the specific modules you need:

```tsx
// Good: Import specific submodules
import { specific } from 'npm:package/specific'

// Avoid: Import entire package
import * as everything from 'npm:package'
```

### Split large functions

Consider breaking large functions into smaller, more focused functions. Each function can handle a specific task, reducing the code needed in any single deployment.

### Choose lightweight alternatives

Research smaller packages that provide the same functionality. Many NPM packages designed for Node.js include unnecessary polyfills that increase bundle size.
