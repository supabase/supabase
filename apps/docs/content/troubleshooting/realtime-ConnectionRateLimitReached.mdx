The error `ConnectionRateLimitReached` means that the number of simultaneous connections to Realtime has exceeded the limit for your plan.

[Realtime Quotas](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime/quotas):

| Plan                  | Concurrent connections |
|-----------------------|------------------------|
| Free                  | 200                    |
| Pro                   | 500                    |
| Pro (no spend cap)    | 10,000                 |
| Team                  | 10,000                 |
| Enterprise            | 10,000+                |


### Example:
On the Free plan, if you reach 200 channel subscriptions, whether from 200 users on one channel or 200 in total spread across multiple channels, adding a 201st will trigger a ConnectionRateLimitReached error.

### How to fix it

Upgrade your plan to allow more concurrent connections or pace the rate that individual users can join channels.
