## Can you keep your 2 free projects after upgrading to pro?

Yes! You still get 2 free projects after you upgrade to Pro. They just need to be in a **separate** Free Plan organization.

## Why do free projects need to be in a separate organization?

Because billing is managed at the organization level, not the project level. We need to keep Free tier usage separate from Pro tier usage for accurate billing and cost transparency.

To keep both free projects and Pro organization:
Create a new Free Plan organization (or use an existing free organization if you have one)

- Go to the [Dashboard](/dashboard)
- Click on the organization dropdown
- Select "New organization" (or visit [https://supabase.com/dashboard/new](/dashboard/new))
- Create a new organization on the default Free Plan
