This guide shows how you can tranfer your Edge Functions from one project to another using the Supabase CLI.

### Pre-requisite
To follow through this guide, you need to note the following:
- You must have the right access priviledges to both the source and target project
- You must have installed the [Supabase CLI tool](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/local-development/cli/getting-started#installing-the-supabase-cli)
- Both source and target projects must be active


**Steps:**

1. Login to your Supabase account (the account with the functions) using your terminal

```bash
supabase login
```

This should open up a web page with an access code. Copy the code, paste it in your terminal and hit enter.


2. List all Edge Functions by running the following command

```bash
supabase functions list --project-ref your_project_ref
```

3. Download the function

```bash
supabase functions download function_name --project-ref your_project_ref
```

Repeat this step to download multiple functions.

This downloads the function(s) into `supabase/functions`. You can view the download function(s) by running

```bash
ls supabase/functions
```

4. Link to the target project

```bash
supabase link --project-ref your_target_project_ref
```

5. Deploy function(s) to target project

```bash
supabase functions deploy --project-ref your_target_project_ref
```

This deploys all functions within the `supabase/functions` to your desired target project. You can confirm by checking your Edge Functions on [your dashboard](/dashboard/project/_/functions)
