This guide shows how you can transfer your Edge Functions from one project to another using the Supabase CLI.

## Pre-requisites

To follow through this guide, you need the following:

- You must have the right access privileges to both the source and target project
- You must have installed the [Supabase CLI tool](/docs/guides/local-development/cli/getting-started#installing-the-supabase-cli)
- Both source and target projects must be active

## Steps:

1. Login to your Supabase account (the account with the functions) using your terminal

```bash
supabase login
```

This should open up a web page with an access code. Copy the code, paste it in your terminal, and hit enter.

2. List all Edge Functions by running the following command

```bash
supabase functions list --project-ref your_project_ref
```

3. Download the function

```bash
supabase functions download function_name --project-ref your_project_ref
```

Repeat this step to download multiple functions.

This downloads the function(s) into `supabase/functions`. You can view the downloaded function(s) by running

```bash
ls supabase/functions
```

4. Link to the target project

```bash
supabase link --project-ref your_target_project_ref
```

5. Deploy function(s) to target project

```bash
supabase functions deploy --project-ref your_target_project_ref
```

This deploys all functions within the `supabase/functions` to the target project. You can confirm by checking your Edge Functions on [the project dashboard](/dashboard/project/_/functions)
