The reason behind this limitation is that the auth helpers library lacks a direct mechanism for performing server-side redirects, as each framework handles redirects differently. However, the library does offer a URL through the data property it returns, which should be utilized for the purpose of redirection.

**NextJS:**

```ts
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
...
const { data } = await supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({
  provider: 'github',
})

return NextResponse.redirect(data.url)
```

**SvelteKit:**

```ts
import { redirect } from '@sveltejs/kit';
...
const { data } = await supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({
  provider: 'github',
})

throw redirect(303, data.url)
```

**Remix:**

```ts
import { redirect } from "@remix-run/node"; // or cloudflare/deno
...
const { data } = await supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({
  provider: 'github',
})

return redirect(data.url)
```
