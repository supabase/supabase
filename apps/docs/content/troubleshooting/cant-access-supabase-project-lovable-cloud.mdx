## Problem

Your Lovable project has **Lovable Cloud** enabled, and you’re trying to connect directly to your Supabase project.

However, you don’t see the project listed on your [Supabase Dashboard](/dashboard), or you’re unable to access it through your Supabase account.

## Why this occurs

When you create a project connected to **Lovable Cloud**, the underlying Supabase instance is provisioned and managed entirely by **Lovable**.

These projects are not owned by your Supabase account, so they **don't appear on your Supabase Dashboard** or be accessible using your Supabase credentials.

## How to diagnose

You might be affected by this if:

- You recently created a project on Lovable and enabled the backend from the chat interface. By default, the Lovable platform uses **Lovable Cloud** for backend hosting.
- You see Supabase references in your project’s configuration but **can’t access the project** from your [Supabase Dashboard](/dashboard).
- The project ID or credentials used in your Lovable setup don’t match any project under your Supabase account.

## How to fix

There is **no automated way** to transfer a Supabase project from Lovable Cloud to your own Supabase account.

However, you can manually clone your project backend and migrate your data following Lovable’s official guide: [Self-Hosting Guide (Lovable Docs)](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/self-hosting)

This process allows you to create a new Supabase project under your own account and connect it independently.

There are certain limitations described in Lovable’s documentation, so review the guide carefully before proceeding.

## How to prevent

If you want direct access to your Supabase project from the start, make sure to:

- Avoid enabling Lovable Cloud if you plan to manage your Supabase project independently.
- Create your project directly from the [Supabase Dashboard](/dashboard) and then **manually connect your Lovable project to your Supabase project**, or **start your Lovable project already connected** to your own Supabase project from the beginning.

      id="sql-editor-access"

    No. Projects running on **Lovable Cloud** use a managed Supabase backend that doesn't provide direct SQL editor access through [supabase.com/dashboard](/dashboard).

    <AccordionItem
      header="Why doesn't my Supabase project appear on my dashboard?"
      id="project-not-showing"
    >

    Lovable Cloud projects are owned and managed by **Lovable**, not by your personal Supabase account. They won't show up on your dashboard.

    <AccordionItem
      header="Can I disconnect my project from Lovable Cloud and connect it to my own Supabase account?"
      id="disconnect-project"
    >

    Once Lovable Cloud is enabled for a project, it **cannot be disconnected or switched** to an external Supabase connection.

    However, you can **create a new Supabase project under your own account** and migrate your data by following Lovable's [Project Migration Guide](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/self-hosting).

    <AccordionItem
      header="I can't get my database URL to connect from an external tool (like BI tools or Postgres connectors)."
      id="database-url"

    External connections are **not supported** when your project runs on Lovable Cloud.

    <AccordionItem
      header="I can't get my service role key to integrate an external service (like n8n or Make.com)."
      id="service-role-key"
    >

    Service role and API keys are **not accessible** for Lovable Cloud–managed projects.

    If you need to integrate with external automation or API-based tools, you'll need to **create and manage your own Supabase project**, then connect Lovable to it directly.
