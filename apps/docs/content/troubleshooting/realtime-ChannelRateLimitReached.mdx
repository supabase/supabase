The error `ChannelRateLimitReached` means that an individual user session is trying to subscribe to more than 100 channels and has reached the limit for your plan.

| Plan                  | Channels per connection |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|
| Free                  | 100                     |
| Pro                   | 100                     |
| Pro (no spend cap)    | 100                     |
| Team                  | 100                     |
| Enterprise            | 100+                    |



### Example:
If a user session on the free plan joins a channel called `chatroom1`, then continues joining additional channels like `chatroom2`, `chatroom3`, and so on up to `chatroom101`, theyâ€™ll hit the limit and receive the error `ChannelRateLimitReached`.

### How to fix it

- Make sure your code isn't joining channels in a loop
- Unsubscribe from channels when they're no longer needed
- If you genuinely need more than 100 channels per connection, consider upgrading your plan or reaching out to [Support](https://supabase.com/dashboard/support/new)
