**Non-SSO User**

For now, we [will not be able to restore access to your account](/docs/guides/platform/multi-factor-authentication#enable-mfa) if you lose all your two-factor authentication credentials. Register a backup factor if necessary.

If you forgot the MFA authentication method used, you can reach out to [our support](/dashboard/support/new).

**SSO User**

Reach out to [our support](/dashboard/support/new) and we will assist you further.
