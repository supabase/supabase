## Overview

When you create a project in **Lovable**, your app’s backend can be connected to one of two options:

- **Lovable Cloud** — The backend (Supabase instance) is managed entirely by **Lovable**.  
- **Your own Supabase project** — The backend is a Supabase project you created and manage directly in your [Supabase Dashboard](/dashboard).

Knowing which backend your project uses helps you understand where your database, API keys, and configuration are managed.

## How to Identify Your Backend

In the Lovable interface, click the **Cloud icon** on the top bar of your project editor. This section shows which backend your project is currently connected to.

<Admonition type="note">

The Cloud icon appears for all projects, regardless of which backend type you're using. Click it to see your actual backend configuration.

</Admonition>

Once you open the Cloud settings, you'll see one of two interfaces depending on your backend type:

### Lovable Cloud Backend

If the screen shows **Lovable Cloud** branding and options managed by Lovable — with **no visible fields for API keys, project reference, or database URL** —  
your backend is managed by **Lovable Cloud**.

Your Supabase instance in this case is **owned and managed by Lovable**, not by your personal Supabase account.  
You won’t see this project in your Supabase Dashboard, and you won’t have access to service role keys or direct database URLs.

### Connected Supabase Backend

If the screen displays fields such as:
- **Supabase project reference** or URL  
- **Service role key** and **anon key**  
- **Database URL**

then your Lovable project is connected to a **Supabase project you manage directly**, and you can access it from your [Supabase Dashboard](/dashboard).

If you can find this project listed in your Supabase Dashboard, you have full control over its database and API keys.

## Summary

| Backend Type             | Managed By | Appears in Supabase Dashboard | Service Role / DB Access |
| ------------------------ | ---------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Lovable Cloud**        | Lovable    | ❌ No                         | ❌ No                    |
| **Own Supabase Project** | You        | ✅ Yes                        | ✅ Yes                   |

    No. Lovable Cloud only affects your **backend connection** (database and APIs), not your app hosting or frontend.

    No. Lovable Cloud backends are managed entirely by Lovable, and connection credentials are not exposed.

    There's no automated way to transfer backends. You can create a new Supabase project and connect your Lovable app to it manually.

    >

    There's no automated way to transfer your backend from Lovable Cloud to your own Supabase account.

    You can create a new Supabase project and migrate your data manually.

    See [Can't Access Your Supabase Project When Using Lovable Cloud](/docs/guides/troubleshooting/cant-access-supabase-project-lovable-cloud) for more details.

      header="My project uses Lovable Cloud, but I can't see my Supabase project."

    >

    That's expected — Lovable Cloud backends are managed by Lovable and don't appear in your Supabase Dashboard.
