## Overview

When you create a project in **Lovable**, your app’s backend can be connected to one of two options:

- **Lovable Cloud** — The backend (Supabase instance) is managed entirely by **Lovable**.  
- **Your own Supabase project** — The backend is a Supabase project you created and manage directly in your [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard).

Knowing which backend your project uses helps you understand where your database, API keys, and configuration are managed.

---

## Step 1: Open the Cloud Settings in Lovable

Inside the Lovable interface, click the **Cloud icon** in the sidebar or top navigation bar (depending on your layout).  

This section shows which backend your project is currently connected to.

---

## Step 2: Check Which Interface You See

### If you see this interface → Your backend is **Lovable Cloud**

The screen will display **Lovable Cloud** branding and options managed by Lovable.  
You won’t see fields for API keys, project reference, or database URLs — since these are not exposed for Lovable Cloud–managed backends.

Your Supabase instance in this case is **owned and managed by Lovable**, not by your personal Supabase account.

---

### If you see this interface → Your backend is **a Supabase project you own**

The screen will display fields such as:
- **Supabase project reference** or URL  
- **Service role key** and **anon key**  
- **Database URL**

This means your Lovable project is connected to a **Supabase project that you manage directly**, and you can access it from your [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard).

---

## Step 3: (Optional) Confirm from the Supabase Dashboard

If your project shows Supabase credentials in Lovable, open the [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard) and verify that you can see the project listed there.

If you can find it, your project is connected to **your own Supabase backend**.  
If not, your project is connected to **Lovable Cloud**.

## Summary

| Backend Type | Managed By | Appears in Supabase Dashboard | Service Role / DB Access |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------------------|----------------|
| **Lovable Cloud** | Lovable | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **Own Supabase Project** | You | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |

## Common Questions

**Does this affect where my app is hosted?**  
No. Lovable Cloud only affects your **backend connection** (database and APIs), not your app hosting or frontend.

**Can I access my database URL or API keys if I’m on Lovable Cloud?**  
No. Lovable Cloud backends are managed entirely by Lovable, and connection credentials are not exposed.

**Can I switch from Lovable Cloud to my own Supabase backend?**  
There’s no automated way to transfer backends. You can create a new Supabase project and connect your Lovable app to it manually.  
See [Lovable’s Project Migration Guide](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/self-hosting) for detailed steps.

## Lovable Cloud–Specific Questions

**My project uses Lovable Cloud, can I move it to Supabase?**  
There’s no automated way to transfer your backend from Lovable Cloud to your own Supabase account.  
You can create a new Supabase project and migrate your data manually.  
See [Can’t Access Your Supabase Project When Using Lovable Cloud](/docs/guides/troubleshooting/cant-access-supabase-project-lovable-cloud) for more details.

**My project uses Lovable Cloud, but I can’t see my Supabase project.**  
That’s expected — Lovable Cloud backends are managed by Lovable and don’t appear in your Supabase dashboard.
