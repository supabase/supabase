I'll be the first to admit that the official naming conventions in the Postgres community can be a bit confusing, so here's a basic rundown. It's a bit long, so feel free to just jump to the portion relevant to you:

## Clients:

This is any server trying to connect to the pooler or database. This can be confusing because the term client in other scenarios also means users connecting through a frontend.

## Client connections:

A single application server can create multiple connections. A client connection represents any connection established by a server to the pooler.

## Direct/database connections:

This represents a direct connection to the database.

Your application servers can directly connect using the db connection string:

```md
postgresql://postgres:[PASSWORD]@db.[PROJECT REF].supabase.co:5432/postgres
```

When connecting through the pooler, it will establish db/direct connections on behalf of clients. It then forwards/triages requests from client connections to db/direct connections.

## max_connections:

Configured with the max_connections system variable, it represents how many direct/database connections postgres will tolerate. You can view your instance's settings by running this SQL:

```sql
SHOW max_connections;
```

To know more about configuring this value, check out [monitoring connections troubleshooting guide.](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/27197)

## Pool size:

The number of direct connections Supavisor is permitted to request from the database to manage each [database/role/mode combination](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/21566).

## Transaction mode:

Transaction mode gives the pooler permission to share direct connections among multiple clients. It is used when the pooler connection string is listening on port 6543:

```md
#example transaction mode string
postgres://postgres.obfwhevidiamwdwki:[YPASSWORD]@aws-0-ca-central-1.pooler.supabase.com:**6543**/postgres
```

Postgres connections use the Postgres Wire Protocol (PWP) rather than HTTP. PWP acts like a websocket: once a connection is made, it stays open and active until the client disconnects.

If too many connections are held by idle or greedy clients, other application servers wonâ€™t be able to connect to your database. Transaction mode helps avoid this problem by allowing clients to access the database connections only when they are running a query. This reduces the chances of hitting the maximum direct connection limit.

## Session mode:

session mode restricts the pooler, forcing it to grant an underlying direct connection exclusively to a single client connection.

```md
#example session mode string | uses port 5432
postgres://postgres.obfwhevidiamwdwki:[YPASSWORD]@aws-0-ca-central-1.pooler.supabase.com:**5432**/postgres
```

Session mode behaves nearly identically to a standard direct connection, which makes one wonder: what is the point?

One benefit is that if you need long-lasting connections in an IPv4-only environment and do not want to enable the IPv4 Add-On, session mode resolves this issue.

Another clear benefit is queueing. If all direct connections were taken, without the pooler, the n+1 client that tried to connect would be rejected. It would have to constantly poll the database to see if a slot became available. The pooler in session mode will queue a client for up to a minute, so it doesn't have to constantly poll while waiting for a slot.
