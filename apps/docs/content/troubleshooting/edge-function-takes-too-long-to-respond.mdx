Edge Functions have a 60-second execution limit. If your function is taking too long to respond, follow these steps to diagnose and optimize performance.

## Diagnose the issue

1. **Check function logs:** Navigate to Functions > [Your Function] > Logs in the dashboard
2. **Examine boot times:** Look for `booted` events and check for consistent boot times
3. **Identify bottlenecks:** Review your code for slow operations

## Analyze boot time patterns

- **If boot times are consistently slow:** The issue is likely in your function's code, such as a large dependency, a slow API call, or a complex computation. Focus on optimizing your code, reducing dependency size, or implementing caching.

- **If only some boot events are slow:** Find the affected `region` in the metadata and submit a support request via the "Help" button at the top of the dashboard.

## Optimize database queries

Inefficient database queries are a common cause of slow responses:

```tsx
// Good: Only select needed columns and limit results
const { data } = await supabase.from('users').select('id, name').limit(10)

// Avoid: Fetching all columns from large tables
const { data } = await supabase.from('users').select('*')
```

## Common causes of slow functions

- **Large dependencies:** Heavy packages increase boot time
- **Slow external API calls:** Third-party services with high latency
- **Complex computations:** CPU-intensive operations
- **Unoptimized database queries:** Fetching more data than needed
- **Cold starts:** First invocation after idle period takes longer
