You can migrate all tables in the auth schema—including users and their hashed passwords—from one Supabase project to another. This means users do not need to reset or recreate their passwords after migration.

## Important: JWT secret and token validity

Each project is provisioned with a unique JWT secret used to sign and verify auth tokens. This has two key implications:

- If the JWT secret is different in the new project, existing tokens will become invalid, and users will be required to log in again to get new tokens.
- If you reuse the original JWT secret in the new project, existing tokens will remain valid and users will not need to re-authenticate.

You can configure a custom JWT secret in the new project by going to:
[Settings > API > JWT Secret](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/api)

Note: Updating the JWT secret will regenerate your anon and service_role API keys in the new project.

## How to migrate Auth data

We don’t currently provide a one-size-fits-all script for migrating only the auth schema, but the process is covered in our general migration guide. You can use either:

- A full .backup file from the dashboard, or
- SQL export/import via the Supabase CLI (e.g., pg_dump and psql)
