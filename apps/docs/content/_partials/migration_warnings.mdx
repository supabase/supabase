<Admonition type="caution">

- If you're planning to migrate a database larger than 6 GB, we recommend [upgrading to at least a Large compute add-on](/docs/guides/platform/compute-add-ons). This will ensure you have the necessary resources to handle the migration efficiently.

- We strongly advise you to pre-provision the disk space you will need for your migration. On paid projects, you can do this by navigating to the [Compute and Disk Settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/compute-and-disk) page. For more information on disk scaling and disk limits, check out our [disk settings](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/compute-and-disk#disk) documentation.
