- If you're planning to migrate a database larger than 6 GB, we recommend [upgrading to at least a Large compute add-on](/docs/guides/platform/compute-add-ons). This will ensure you have the necessary resources to handle the migration efficiently.

- You can increase the size of the [disk](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/compute-and-disk#disk) on paid projects according to need by navigating to the [Compute and Disk Settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/compute-and-disk) page.
