<Admonition type="caution">

The Auth helpers package is deprecated. Use the new `@supabase/ssr` package for Server Side Authentication. `@supabase/ssr` takes the core concepts of the Auth Helpers package and makes them available to any server framework. Read out the [migration doc](/docs/guides/auth/server-side/migrating-to-ssr-from-auth-helpers) to learn more.
