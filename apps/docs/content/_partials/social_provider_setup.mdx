The next step requires a callback URL, which looks like this: `https://<project-ref>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`

- Go to your [Supabase Project Dashboard](/dashboard)
- Click on the `Authentication` icon in the left sidebar
- Click on [`Sign In / Providers`](/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers) under the Configuration section
- Click on **{{ .provider }}** from the accordion list to expand and you'll find your **Callback URL**, you can click `Copy` to copy it to the clipboard

#### Local development

When testing OAuth locally with the Supabase CLI, ensure your OAuth provider
is configured with the local Supabase Auth callback URL:

http://localhost:54321/auth/v1/callback

If this callback URL is missing or misconfigured, OAuth sign-in may fail or not redirect correctly during local development.

See the [local development docs](/docs/guides/local-development) for more details.

For testing OAuth locally with the Supabase CLI see the [local development docs](/docs/guides/local-development).
