## Project setup

Before we start building we're going to set up our Database and API. This is as simple as starting a new Project in Supabase and then creating a "schema" inside the database.

### Create a project

1. [Create a new project](https://app.supabase.com) in the Supabase Dashboard.
1. Enter your project details.
1. Wait for the new database to launch.

### Set up the database schema

Now we are going to set up the database schema. You can just copy/paste the SQL from below and run it yourself.

<Tabs
  scrollable
  size="small"
  type="underlined"
  defaultActiveId="sql"
  queryGroup="database-method"
>
{/* <TabPanel id="dashboard" label="Dashboard">

1. Go to the [SQL Editor](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/sql) page in the Dashboard.
2. Click **Product Management**.
3. Click **Run**.

</TabPanel> */}
<TabPanel id="sql" label="SQL">

<$Partial path="product_management_sql_template.mdx" />

</TabPanel>
</Tabs>

<$Partial path="api_settings.mdx" />

### Set up Google authentication

From the [Google Console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library), create a new project and add OAuth2 credentials.

![Create Google OAuth credentials](/docs/img/guides/kotlin/google-cloud-oauth-credentials-create.png)

In your [Supabase Auth settings](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/auth/providers) enable Google as a provider and set the required credentials as outlined in the [auth docs](/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-google).
