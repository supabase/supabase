## Project setup

Let's create a new Postgres database. This is as simple as starting a new Project in Supabase:

1. [Create a new project](https://database.new/) in the Supabase dashboard.
1. Enter your project details. Remember to store your password somewhere safe.

Your database will be available in less than a minute.

**Finding your credentials:**

You can find your project credentials on the dashboard:

- [Database connection strings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/api?showConnect=true): Direct and Pooler connection details including the connection string and parameters.
- [Database password](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/database/settings): Reset database password here if you do not have it.
- [API credentials](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/api): your serverless API URL and `anon` / `service_role` keys.
