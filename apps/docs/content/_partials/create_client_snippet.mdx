<Admonition type="tip">

Make sure you're using the right `supabase` client in the following code.

If you're not using Server-Side Rendering or cookie-based Auth, you can directly use the `createClient` from `@supabase/supabase-js`. If you're using Server-Side Rendering, see the [Server-Side Auth guide](/docs/guides/auth/server-side/creating-a-client) for instructions on creating your Supabase client.
