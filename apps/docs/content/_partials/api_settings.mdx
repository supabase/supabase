### Get API details

Now that you've created some database tables, you are ready to insert data using the auto-generated API.

To do this, you need to get the Project URL and key. Get the URL from [the API settings section](/dashboard/project/_/settings/api) of a project and the key from the [the API Keys section of a project's Settings page](/dashboard/project/_/settings/api-keys/).

<Admonition type="note" title="Changes to API keys">

Supabase is changing the way keys work to improve project security and developer experience. You can [read the full announcement](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/29260), but in the transition period, you can use both the current `anon` and `service_role` keys and the new publishable key with the form `sb_publishable_xxx` which will replace the older keys.

To get the key values, open [the API Keys section of a project's Settings page](/dashboard/project/_/settings/api-keys/) and do the following:

- **For legacy keys**, copy the `anon` key for client-side operations and the `service_role` key for server-side operations from the **Legacy API Keys** tab.
- **For new keys**, open the **API Keys** tab, if you don't have a publishable key already, click **Create new API Keys**, and copy the value from the **Publishable key** section.
