title: Expose Queues for local and self-hosted Supabase
subtitle: Learn how to expose Queues when running Supabase with Supabase CLI or Docker Compose
---

By default, local and self-hosted Supabase instances expose only core schemas like public and graphql_public.
To allow client-side consumers to use your queues, you have to add `pgmq_public` schema to the list of exposed schemas.

Before continuing, complete the step [Expose queues to client-side consumers](/docs/guides/queues/quickstart#expose-queues-to-client-side-consumers) from the Queues Quickstart guide. This creates the `pgmq_public` schema, which must exist before it can be exposed through the API.

<Admonition type="note">

You only need to expose the `pgmq_public` schema manually when running Supabase locally with the Supabase CLI or self-hosting using Docker Compose.

## Expose Queues with Supabase CLI

When running Supabase locally with Supabase CLI, update your project's `config.toml` file.
Locate the `[api]` section and add `pgmq_public` to the list of schemas.

```toml
[api]
enabled = true
port = 54321
schemas = ["public", "graphql_public", "pgmq_public"]
```

Then restart your local Supabase stack.

```bash
supabase stop && supabase start
```

## Expose queues with Docker compose

When running Supabase with Docker Compose, locate the `PGRST_DB_SCHEMAS` variable inside your `.env` file and add `pgmq_public` to it. This environment variable is passed to the `rest` service inside `compose.yaml`.

```
PGRST_DB_SCHEMAS=public,graphql_public,pgmq_public
```

Restart your containers for the changes to take effect.

```bash
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```

## Stop exposing queues

If you no longer want to expose the `pgmq_public` schema, you can remove it from your configuration.

- For Supabase CLI, remove `pgmq_public` from the `[api]` schemas list in your `config.toml` file.
- For Docker Compose, remove `pgmq_public` from the `PGRST_DB_SCHEMAS` variable in your `.env` file.

After updating your configuration, restart your containers for the changes to take effect.
