[Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock) is a fully managed service that offers a choice of high-performing foundation models (FMs) from leading AI companies like AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, Mistral AI, Stability AI, and Amazon. Each model is accessible through a common API which implements a broad set of features to help build generative AI applications with security, privacy, and responsible AI in mind.

This guide will walk you through an example using Amazon Bedrock SDK with `vecs`. We will create embeddings using the Amazon Titan Embeddings G1 – Text v1.2 (amazon.titan-embed-text-v1) model, insert these embeddings into a PostgreSQL database using vecs, and then query the collection to find the most similar sentences to a given query sentence.

## Create an Environment

First, you need to set up your environment. You will need Python 3.7+ with the `vecs` and `boto3` libraries installed.

You can install the necessary Python libraries using pip:

```sh
pip install vecs boto3
```

You'll also need:

- [Credentials to your AWS account](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/credentials.html)
- [A Postgres Database with the pgvector extension](hosting.md)

## Create Embeddings

Next, we will use Amazon’s Titan Embedding G1 - Text v1.2 model to create embeddings for a set of sentences.

```python
import boto3
import vecs
import json

client = boto3.client(
    'bedrock-runtime',
    region_name='us-east-1',
	# Credentials from your AWS account
    aws_access_key_id='<replace_your_own_credentials>',
    aws_secret_access_key='<replace_your_own_credentials>',
    aws_session_token='<replace_your_own_credentials>',
)

dataset = [
    "The cat sat on the mat.",
    "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.",
    "Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears",
    "To be or not to be, that is the question.",
]

embeddings = []

for sentence in dataset:
    # invoke the embeddings model for each sentence
    response = client.invoke_model(
        body= json.dumps({"inputText": sentence}),
        modelId= "amazon.titan-embed-text-v1",
        accept = "application/json",
        contentType = "application/json"
    )
    # collect the embedding from the response
    response_body = json.loads(response["body"].read())
    # add the embedding to the embedding list
    embeddings.append((sentence, response_body.get("embedding"), {}))

```

### Store the Embeddings with vecs

Now that we have our embeddings, we can insert them into a PostgreSQL database using vecs.

```python
import vecs

DB_CONNECTION = "postgresql://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<db_name>"

# create vector store client
vx = vecs.Client(DB_CONNECTION)

# create a collection named 'sentences' with 1536 dimensional vectors
# to match the default dimension of the Titan Embeddings G1 - Text model
sentences = vx.get_or_create_collection(name="sentences", dimension=1536)

# upsert the embeddings into the 'sentences' collection
sentences.upsert(records=embeddings)

# create an index for the 'sentences' collection
sentences.create_index()
```

### Querying for Most Similar Sentences

Now, we query the `sentences` collection to find the most similar sentences to a sample query sentence. First need to create an embedding for the query sentence. Next, we query the collection we created earlier to find the most similar sentences.

```python
query_sentence = "A quick animal jumps over a lazy one."

# create vector store client
vx = vecs.Client(DB_CONNECTION)

# create an embedding for the query sentence
response = client.invoke_model(
        body= json.dumps({"inputText": query_sentence}),
        modelId= "amazon.titan-embed-text-v1",
        accept = "application/json",
        contentType = "application/json"
    )

response_body = json.loads(response["body"].read())

query_embedding = response_body.get("embedding")

# query the 'sentences' collection for the most similar sentences
results = sentences.query(
    data=query_embedding,
    limit=3,
    include_value = True
)

# print the results
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This returns the most similar 3 records and their distance to the query vector.

```
('The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.', 0.27600620558852)
('The cat sat on the mat.', 0.609986272479202)
('To be or not to be, that is the question.', 0.744849503688346)
```
