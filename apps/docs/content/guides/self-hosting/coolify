Coolify is an open-source, self-hosting platform that simplifies deploying and managing applications like Supabase. This guide assumes you are running the commands from the machine you intend to host from.

You need the following installed on your system:

- A server or virtual machine with a Linux-based OS (Ubuntu, Debian, etc.)
- Root or sudo access to the server
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- A domain name pointed to your server's IP (optional but recommended)
