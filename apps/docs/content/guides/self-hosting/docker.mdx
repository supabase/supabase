3. [Accessing your services](#accessing-supabase-studio)
4. [Updating your services](#updating-your-services)
5. [Securing your services](#securing-your-services)

## Before you begin

You need the following installed in your system: [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and Docker ([Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/), [macOS](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/), or [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/)).

## Installing and running Supabase

Follow these steps to start Supabase on your machine:

```sh
# Get the code
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/supabase/supabase

# Make your new supabase project directory
mkdir supabase-project

# Tree should look like this
# .
# ├── supabase
# └── supabase-project

# Copy the compose files over to your project
cp -rf supabase/docker/* supabase-project

# Copy the fake env vars
cp supabase/docker/.env.example supabase-project/.env

# Switch to your project directory
cd supabase-project

# Pull the latest images

```

</tabpanel>
</tabs>
<admonition type="tip">

If you are using rootless docker, edit `.env` and set `DOCKER_SOCKET_LOCATION` to your docker socket location. For example: `/run/user/1000/docker.sock`. Otherwise, you will see an error like `container supabase-vector exited (0)`.

</admonition>

After all the services have started you can see them running in the background:

```sh
docker compose ps
```

All of the services should have a status `running (healthy)`. If you see a status like `created` but not `running`, try starting that service manually with `docker compose start <service-name>`.

### Accessing Supabase Studio

You can access Supabase Studio through the API gateway on port `8000`. For example: `http://<your-ip>:8000`, or [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) if you are running Docker locally.

You will be prompted for a username and password. By default, the credentials are:

- Username: `supabase`
- Password: `this_password_is_insecure_and_should_be_updated`

You should change these credentials as soon as possible using the [instructions](#dashboard-authentication) below.

### Accessing the APIs

Each of the APIs are available through the same API gateway:

- REST: `http://<your-ip>:8000/rest/v1/`
- Auth: `http://<your-domain>:8000/auth/v1/`
- Storage: `http://<your-domain>:8000/storage/v1/`
- Realtime: `http://<your-domain>:8000/realtime/v1/`

### Accessing your Edge Functions

Edge Functions are stored in `volumes/functions`. The default setup has a `hello` Function that you can invoke on `http://<your-domain>:8000/functions/v1/hello`.

You can add new Functions as `volumes/functions/<function_name>/index.ts`. Restart the `functions` service to pick up the changes: `docker compose restart functions --no-deps`

### Accessing Postgres

By default, the Supabase stack runs the [Supavisor](https://supabase.github.io/supavisor/development/docs/) connection pooler. Supavisor provides efficient management of database connections.

You can connect to the Postgres database using the following methods:

1. For session-based connections (equivalent to direct Postgres connections):

```bash
psql 'postgres://postgres.your-tenant-id:your-super-secret-and-long-postgres-password@localhost:5432/postgres'
```

2. For pooled transactional connections:

```bash
psql 'postgres://postgres.your-tenant-id:your-super-secret-and-long-postgres-password@localhost:6543/postgres'
```

The default tenant ID is `your-tenant-id`, and the default password is `your-super-secret-and-long-postgres-password`. You should change these as soon as possible using the [instructions below](#update-secrets).

By default, the database is not accessible from outside the local machine but the pooler is. You can [change this](#exposing-your-postgres-database) by updating the `docker-compose.yml` file.

You may also want to connect to your Postgres database via an ORM or another direct method other than `psql`.

For this you can use the standard Postgres connection string.
You can find the the environment values mentioned below in the `.env` file which will be covered in the next section.

```
postgres://postgres:[POSTGRES_PASSWORD]@[your-server-ip]:5432/[POSTGRES_DB]
```

## Updating your services

For security reasons, we "pin" the versions of each service in the docker-compose file (these versions are updated ~monthly). If you want to update any services immediately, you can do so by updating the version number in the docker compose file and then running `docker compose pull`. You can find all the latest docker images in the [Supabase Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/supabase).

You should update your services frequently to get the latest features and bug fixes and security patches. Note that you will need to restart the services to pick up the changes, which will result in some downtime for your services.

**Example**
You'll want to update the Studio(Dashboard) frequently to get the latest features and bug fixes. To update the Dashboard:

1. Visit the [supabase/studio](https://hub.docker.com/r/supabase/studio/tags) image in the [Supabase Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/supabase)
2. Find the latest version (tag) number. It will look something like `20241029-46e1e40`
3. Update the `image` field in the `docker-compose.yml` file to the new version. It should look like this: `image: supabase/studio:20241028-a265374`
4. Run `docker compose pull` and then `docker compose up -d` to restart the service with the new version.

## Securing your services

While we provided you with some example secrets for getting started, you should NEVER deploy your Supabase setup using the defaults we have provided. Follow all of the steps in this section to ensure you have a secure setup, and then [restart all services](#restarting-all-services) to pick up the changes.

### Generate API keys

We need to generate secure keys for accessing your services. We'll use the `JWT Secret` to generate `anon` and `service` API keys using the form below.

1. **Obtain a Secret**: Use the 40-character secret provided, or create your own. If creating, ensure it's a strong, random string of 40 characters.
2. **Store Securely**: Save the secret in a secure location on your local machine. Don't share this secret publicly or commit it to version control.
3. **Generate a JWT**: Use the form below to generate a new `JWT` using your secret.

### Update API keys

Run this form twice to generate new `anon` and `service` API keys. Replace the values in the `./docker/.env` file:

- `ANON_KEY` - replace with an `anon` key
- `SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - replace with a `service` key

You will need to [restart](#restarting-all-services) the services for the changes to take effect.

### Update secrets

Update the `./docker/.env` file with your own secrets. In particular, these are required:

- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: the password for the `postgres` role.
- `JWT_SECRET`: used by PostgREST and GoTrue, among others.
- `SITE_URL`: the base URL of your site.
- `SMTP_*`: mail server credentials. You can use any SMTP server.
- `POOLER_TENANT_ID`: the tenant-id that will be used by Supavisor pooler for your connection string

You will need to [restart](#restarting-all-services) the services for the changes to take effect.

### Configuring SECRET_KEY_BASE

`SECRET_KEY_BASE` is a critical secret used for session encryption, token signing, and other cryptographic operations by components that rely on it. Treat it like a password: never share it publicly or commit it to version control.

- Generate a strong key (use one of):
  - Hex (64 bytes/128 hex chars): `openssl rand -hex 64`
  - Base64 (~48 bytes): `openssl rand -base64 48`
  - Use a unique value per environment (dev/staging/prod). Do not reuse.

- Where to set it:
  - Local development: add `SECRET_KEY_BASE=` to your local `.env` (ensure `.env` is in `.gitignore`).
  - Docker Compose: add to the relevant service `environment` in `docker-compose.yml`, for example:

```yaml docker-compose.yml
services:
  auth:
    environment:
      SECRET_KEY_BASE: ${SECRET_KEY_BASE}
```

```bash .env
# Example only. Replace with your own generated value.
SECRET_KEY_BASE=REPLACE_WITH_A_SECURE_RANDOM_VALUE
```

  - systemd: set as an environment variable, e.g. `Environment=SECRET_KEY_BASE=YOUR_GENERATED_VALUE`
  - Kubernetes: store as a Secret and mount as an env var, e.g.

```yaml
env:
  - name: SECRET_KEY_BASE
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: supabase-secrets
        key: SECRET_KEY_BASE
```

- Rotation guidance: rotate with caution—changing this will invalidate existing sessions and any data encrypted with the old key. Plan a maintenance window, update the secret, roll your containers, and force clients to re-authenticate.

- Samples in this guide and in `.env.example` are placeholders for illustration only. Always replace any hardcoded sample values with your own secure, unique secrets.

### Dashboard authentication

The Dashboard is protected with basic authentication. The default user and password MUST be updated before using Supabase in production.
Update the following values in the `./docker/.env` file:

- `DASHBOARD_USERNAME`: The default username for the Dashboard
- `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD`: The default password for the Dashboard

You can also add more credentials for multiple users in `./docker/volumes/api/kong.yml`. For example:

```yaml docker/volumes/api/kong.yml
basicauth_credentials:
  - consumer: DASHBOARD
    username: user_one
    password: password_one
  - consumer: DASHBOARD
    username: user_two
    password: password_two
```

To enable all dashboard features outside of `localhost`, update the following value in the `./docker/.env` file:

- `SUPABASE_PUBLIC_URL`: The URL or IP used to access the dashboard

You will need to [restart](#restarting-all-services) the services for the changes to take effect.

## Restarting all services

You can restart services to pick up any configuration changes by running:

```sh
# Stop and remove the containers
docker compose down

# Recreate and start the containers
docker compose up -d
```

{/* supa-mdx-lint-disable-next-line Rule004ExcludeWords */}

Be aware that this will result in downtime. Simply restarting the services does not apply configuration changes.

## Stopping all services

You can stop Supabase by running `docker compose stop` in same directory as your `docker-compose.yml` file.

## Uninstalling

You can stop Supabase by running the following in same directory as your `docker-compose.yml` file:

```sh
# Stop docker and remove volumes:
docker compose down -v

# Remove Postgres data:
rm -rf volumes/db/data/
```

This will destroy all data in the database and storage volumes, so be careful!

## Managing your secrets

Many components inside Supabase use secure secrets and passwords. These are listed in the self-hosting [env file](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/master/docker/.env.example), but we strongly recommend using a secrets manager when deploying to production. Plain text files like dotenv lead to accidental costly leaks.

Some suggested systems include:

- [Doppler](https://www.doppler.com/)
- [Infisical](https://infisical.com/)
- [Key Vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/overview) by Azure (Microsoft)
- [Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/) by AWS
- [Secrets Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager) by GCP
- [Vault](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/vault) by HashiCorp

## Advanced

Everything beyond this point in the guide helps you understand how the system works and how you can modify it to suit your needs.

### Architecture

Supabase is a combination of open source tools, each specifically chosen for Enterprise-readiness.

If the tools and communities already exist, with an MIT, Apache 2, or equivalent open license, we will use and support that tool. If the tool doesn't exist, we build and open source it ourselves.

<image alt="Diagram showing the architecture of Supabase. The Kong API gateway sits in front of 7 services: GoTrue, PostgREST, Realtime, Storage, pg_meta, Functions, and pg_graphql. All the services talk to a single Postgres instance." dark="" light="" src="{{"/>

- [Kong](https://github.com/Kong/kong) is a cloud-native API gateway.
- [GoTrue](https://github.com/supabase/gotrue) is an JWT based API for managing users and issuing JWT tokens.
- [PostgREST](http://postgrest.org/) is a web server that turns your Postgres database directly into a RESTful API
- [Realtime](https://github.com/supabase/realtime) is an Elixir server that allows you to listen to Postgres inserts, updates, and deletes using WebSockets. Realtime polls Postgres' built-in replication functionality for database changes, converts changes to JSON, then broadcasts the JSON over WebSockets to authorized clients.
- [Storage](https://github.com/supabase/storage-api) provides a RESTful interface for managing Files stored in S3, using Postgres to manage permissions.
- [`postgres-meta`](https://github.com/supabase/postgres-meta) is a RESTful API for managing your Postgres, allowing you to fetch tables, add roles, and run queries, etc.
- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) is an object-relational database system with over 30 years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.
- [Supavisor](https://github.com/supabase/supavisor) is a scalable connection pooler for Postgres, allowing for efficient management of database connections.

For the system to work cohesively, some services require additional configuration within the Postgres database. For example, the APIs and Auth system require several [default roles](/docs/guides/database/postgres
