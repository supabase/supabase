Log drains will send all logs of the Supabase stack to one or more desired destinations. It is only available for customers on Team and Enterprise Plans. Log drains is available in the dashboard under [Project Settings > Log Drains](/dashboard/project/_/settings/log-drains).

You can read about the initial announcement [here](/blog/log-drains) and vote for your preferred drains in [this discussion](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/28324?sort=top).

# Supported destinations

The following table lists the supported destinations and the required setup configuration:

| Destination           | Transport Method | Configuration                                                                          |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Generic HTTP endpoint | HTTP             | URL <br /> HTTP Version <br/> Gzip <br /> Headers                                      |
| Datadog               | HTTP             | API Key <br /> Region                                                                  |
| Loki                  | HTTP             | URL <br /> Headers                                                                     |
| Sentry                | HTTP             | DSN                                                                                    |
| Amazon S3             | AWS SDK          | S3 Bucket <br/> Region <br/> Access Key ID <br/> Secret Access Key <br/> Batch Timeout |

HTTP requests are batched with a max of 250 logs or 1 second intervals, whichever happens first. Logs are compressed via Gzip if the destination supports it.

## Generic HTTP endpoint

Logs are sent as a POST request with a JSON body. Both HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 protocols are supported.
Custom headers can optionally be configured for all requests.

Note that requests are **unsigned**.

<Admonition type="note">

Unsigned requests to HTTP endpoints are temporary and all requests will signed in the near future.

      id="uncompressed"
    >

1. Create and deploy the edge function

Generate a new edge function template and update it to log out the received JSON payload. For simplicity, we will accept any request with an Anon Key.

```bash
supabase functions new hello-world
```

You can use this example snippet as an illustration of how the received request will be like.

```ts
import 'npm:@supabase/functions-js/edge-runtime.d.ts'

Deno.serve(async (req) => {
  const data = await req.json()

  console.log(`Received ${data.length} logs, first log:\n ${JSON.stringify(data[0])}`)
  return new Response(JSON.stringify({ message: 'ok' }), {
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  })
})
```

And then deploy it with:

```bash
supabase functions deploy hello-world --project-ref [PROJECT REF]
```

<Admonition type="caution">

This will create an infinite loop, as we are generating an additional log event that will eventually trigger a new request to this edge function. However, due to the batching nature of how Log Drain events are dispatched, the rate of edge function triggers will not increase greatly and will have an upper bound.

</Admonition>

2. Configure the HTTP Drain

Create a HTTP drain under the [Project Settings > Log Drains](/dashboard/project/_/settings/log-drains).

- Disable the Gzip, as we want to receive the payload without compression.
- Under URL, set it to your edge function URL `https://[PROJECT REF].supabase.co/functions/v1/hello-world`
- Under Headers, set the `Authorization: Bearer [ANON KEY]`

<ProjectConfigVariables variable="publishableKey" />

    <AccordionItem
      header="Edge Function Gzip Example"
      id="gzip"
    >

Gzip payloads can be decompressed using native in-built APIs. Refer to the Edge Function [compression guide](/docs/guides/functions/compression)

```ts
import { gunzipSync } from 'node:zlib'

Deno.serve(async (req) => {
  try {
    // Check if the request body is gzip compressed
    const contentEncoding = req.headers.get('content-encoding')
    if (contentEncoding !== 'gzip') {
      return new Response('Request body is not gzip compressed', {
        status: 400,
      })
    }

    // Read the compressed body
    const compressedBody = await req.arrayBuffer()

    // Decompress the body
    const decompressedBody = gunzipSync(new Uint8Array(compressedBody))

    // Convert the decompressed body to a string
    const decompressedString = new TextDecoder().decode(decompressedBody)
    const data = JSON.parse(decompressedString)
    // Process the decompressed body as needed
    console.log(`Received: ${data.length} logs.`)

    return new Response('ok', {
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' },
    })
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error)
    return new Response('Error processing request', { status: 500 })
  }
})
```

    </AccordionItem>

## Datadog logs

Logs sent to Datadog have the name of the log source set on the `service` field of the event and the source set to `Supabase`. Logs are gzipped before they are sent to Datadog.

The payload message is a JSON string of the raw log event, prefixed with the event timestamp.

To setup Datadog log drain, generate a Datadog API key [here](https://app.datadoghq.com/organization-settings/api-keys) and the location of your Datadog site.

    1. Generate API Key in [Datadog dashboard](https://app.datadoghq.com/organization-settings/api-keys)
    2. Create log drain in [Supabase dashboard](/dashboard/project/_/settings/log-drains)
    3. Watch for events in the [Datadog Logs page](https://app.datadoghq.com/logs)

## Loki

Logs sent to the Loki HTTP API are specifically formatted according to the HTTP API requirements. See the official Loki HTTP API documentation for [more details](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/reference/loki-http-api/#ingest-logs).

Events are batched with a maximum of 250 events per request.

The log source and product name will be used as stream labels.

The `event_message` and `timestamp` fields will be dropped from the events to avoid duplicate data.

Loki must be configured to accept **structured metadata**, and it is advised to increase the default maximum number of structured metadata fields to at least 500 to accommodate large log event payloads of different products.

## Sentry

Logs are sent to Sentry as part of [Sentry's Logging Product](https://docs.sentry.io/product/explore/logs/). Ingesting Supabase logs as Sentry errors is currently not supported.

To setup the Sentry log drain, you need to do the following:

1. Grab your DSN from your [Sentry project settings](https://docs.sentry.io/concepts/key-terms/dsn-explainer/). It should be of the format `{PROTOCOL}://{PUBLIC_KEY}:{SECRET_KEY}@{HOST}{PATH}/{PROJECT_ID}`.
2. Create log drain in [Supabase dashboard](/dashboard/project/_/settings/log-drains)
3. Watch for events in the [Sentry Logs page](https://sentry.io/explore/logs/)

All fields from the log event are attached as attributes to the Sentry log, which can be used for filtering and grouping in the Sentry UI. There are no limits to cardinality or the number of attributes that can be attached to a log.

If you are self-hosting Sentry, Sentry Logs are only supported in self-hosted version [25.9.0](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/releases/tag/25.9.0) and later.

## Amazon S3

Logs are written to an existing S3 bucket that you own.

Required configuration when creating an S3 Log Drain:

- S3 Bucket: the name of an existing S3 bucket.
- Region: the AWS region where the bucket is located.
- Access Key ID: used for authentication.
- Secret Access Key: used for authentication.
- Batch Timeout (ms): maximum time to wait before flushing a batch. Recommended 2000–5000ms.

<Admonition type="note">

Ensure the AWS account tied to the Access Key ID has permissions to write to the specified S3 bucket.
