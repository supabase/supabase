{/* last LW we added that same report to every report page (pre-filtered) so, API Gateway report filtered by Auth will show the same data as going to Auth Report in the API Gateway section */}

Supabase Reports provide comprehensive observability for your project through dedicated monitoring dashboards that visualize key metrics across your database, auth, storage, realtime, and API systems. Each report offers self-debugging tools to gain actionable insights for optimizing performance and troubleshooting issues.

<Admonition type="note">

Reports are only available for projects hosted on the Supabase Cloud platform and are not available for self-hosted instances.

## Using reports

You can filter reports by time range to focus your analysis on specific periods. Your organization's plans gate available time ranges, with higher-tier plans providing access to longer historical periods.
