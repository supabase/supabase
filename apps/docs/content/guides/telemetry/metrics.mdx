description: 'Export Supabase database metrics to any Prometheus-compatible tool'
---

Every Supabase project exposes a [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)-compatible **Metrics API** endpoint that surfaces ~200 Postgres performance and health series. You can scrape it into any observability stack to power custom dashboards, alerting rules, or long-term retention that goes beyond what Supabase Studio provides out of the box.

<Admonition type="note">

The Metrics API is currently in beta. Metric names and labels might evolve as we expand the dataset, and the feature is not available in self-hosted Supabase instances.

## What you can do with the Metrics API

- Stream database CPU, IO, WAL, connection, and query stats into Prometheus-compatible systems.
- Combine Supabase metrics with application signals in Grafana, Datadog, or any other observability vendor.
- Reuse our <a href="https://github.com/supabase/supabase-grafana" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">supabase-grafana dashboard JSON</a> to bootstrap over 200 ready-made charts.
- Build your own alerting policies (right-sizing, saturation detection, index regression, and more).

## Choose your monitoring stack

Pick the workflow that best matches your tooling. Each card opens a Supabase-authored guide, and some also include a “Community” pill when there’s an accompanying vendor integration reference.
