Read Replicas are Postgres databases that are continuously synced to a Supabase project's Primary database. You can both read from and write to a Primary database, but you can _only_ read from a Read Replica, such as using `select` statements.

|              | select | insert | update | delete |
| ------------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Primary      | ‚úÖ     | ‚úÖ     | ‚úÖ     | ‚úÖ     |
| Read Replica | ‚úÖ     | -      | -      | -      |

A database is spun up automatically with every Supabase project. This database is the Primary database. You can choose to add Read Replicas to your project and those Replicas will receive and synchronize data from the Primary database.

Replication is asynchronous and happens in the background so transactions on the Primary aren't blocked. The time delay between writing data to the Primary and the Read Replica receiving the change is replication lag.

Read Replicas have many applications:

- They reduce read load on the Primary database.
  - For example, you can use a Read Replica for complex analytical queries and reserve the Primary for user-facing create, update, and delete operations.
- For projects that need to cover a global audience, additional databases can be deployed closer to users in any of our twelve supported regions to reduce latency.
- Read Replicas provide data redundancy.

## Prerequisites

A project needs to satisfy these requirements to deploy a Read Replica:

1. Running on AWS.
   - Support for projects on Fly.io is coming.
1. Running on at least a [Small compute add-on](/docs/guides/platform/compute-add-ons).
   - Read Replicas are currently placed on the same compute instance as the database to make sure they can keep up with the Primary's activities.
1. Running on Postgres 15.
   - For projects running on older versions of PostgreSQL, you will need to [upgrade to the latest platform version](/docs/guides/platform/migrating-and-upgrading-projects#pgupgrade).
1. Using [physical backups](/docs/guides/platform/backups#point-in-time-recovery)
   - Physical backups are automatically enabled if using [PITR](/docs/guides/platform/backups#point-in-time-recovery)
   - If you're not using PITR, you'll be able to switch to physical backups as part of the Read Replica setup process. Note that physical backups can't be downloaded from the dashboard in the way logical backups can.

## Getting started

Read Replicas can be managed from the [infrastructure settings page](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/infrastructure). For now, each project can only deploy up to two Read Replicas and all Read Replicas inherit the compute size of their Primary database.

Read Replicas offer the following features:

### Dedicated endpoints

Each Read Replica has its own dedicated database and API endpoints. The database endpoint can be found in your [dashboard database settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/database) under **Connection info**. The API endpoint can be found in [dashboard API settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/api) under **Project URL**.

A Read Replica's API endpoint only supports `GET` requests to the [REST API](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/api). Requests towards other Supabase products, such as Auth, Storage, and Realtime, are not able to utilize a Read Replica nor its API endpoint for now. We are working on adding Read Replica support for them.

### Dedicated connection pool

A connection pool through Supavisor is also available for each Read Replica. Its unique connection string can be found in your [dashboard database settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/database) under **Connection string**.

### Querying through the SQL editor

        src="/docs/img/guides/platform/read-replicas/sql-editor.png?v=1"
    />

In the SQL editor, you can choose if you want to run the query on the Primary or one of the Replicas.

### API load balancer

When Read Replicas are deployed, an API load balancer becomes available for the project. An endpoint for it is provisioned and can be found [here](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/api).

The load balancer uses a round-robin strategy to route `GET` requests to any of the API endpoints available, including that of the Primary database. Non-`GET` requests can also be sent through this endpoint. They are immediately redirected to the Primary database.

Similar to the Read Replica API endpoints, only requests to the REST API are available for now. Support for other Supabase products will become available once Read Replica support has been completed for them.

When a project no longer has any Read Replicas, the load balancer and its endpoint are brought down as well.

### Centralized configuration management

All settings made through the dashboard will be propagated across all databases of a project. This ensures that no Read Replica get out of sync with its Primary database or with other Read Replicas.

## How are Read Replicas made?

We use a hybrid approach to replicate data from a Primary to its Read Replicas, combining the native methods of streaming replication and file-based log shipping.

### Streaming replication

Postgres generates a Write Ahead Log (WAL) as database changes occur. With streaming replication, these changes stream from the Primary to the Read Replica server. The WAL alone is sufficient to reconstruct the database to its current state.

This replication method is fast, since changes are streamed directly from the Primary to the Read Replica. On the other hand, it faces challenges when the Read Replica can't keep up with the WAL changes from its Primary. This can happen when the Read Replica is too small, running on degraded hardware, or has a heavier workload running.

To address this, Postgres does provide tunable configuration, like `wal_keep_size`, to adjust the WAL retained by the Primary. If the Read Replica fails to ‚Äúcatch up‚Äù before the WAL surpasses the `wal_keep_size` setting, the replication is terminated. Tuning is a bit of an art - the amount of WAL required is variable for every situation.

### File-based log shipping

In this replication method, the Primary continuously buffers WAL changes to a local file and then sends the file to the Read Replica. If multiple Read Replicas are present, files could also be sent to an intermediary location accessible by all. The Read Replica then reads the WAL files and applies those changes. There is higher replication lag than streaming replication since the Primary buffers the changes locally first. It also means there is a small chance that WAL changes do not reach Read Replicas if the Primary goes down before the file is transferred. In these cases, if the Primary fails a Replica using streaming replication would (in most cases) be more up-to-date than a Replica using file-based log shipping.

### File-based log shipping ü§ù streaming replication

We bring these two methods together to achieve quick, stable, and reliable replication. Each method addresses the limitations of the other. Streaming replication minimizes replication lag, while file-based log shipping provides a fallback. For file-based log shipping, we use our existing Point In Time Recovery (PITR) infrastructure. We regularly archive files from the Primary using [WAL-G](https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g), an open source archival and restoration tool, and ship the WAL files to S3.

We combine it with streaming replication to reduce replication lag. Once WAL-G files have been synced from S3, Read Replicas connect to the Primary and stream the WAL directly.

## Operations blocked by Read Replicas

### Project upgrades and data restorations

The following procedures require all Read Replicas for a project to be brought down before they can be performed:

1. [Project upgrades](/docs/guides/platform/migrating-and-upgrading-projects#pgupgrade)
1. [Data restorations](/docs/guides/platform/backups#pitr-restoration-process)

These operations need to be completed before Read Replicas can be re-deployed.
