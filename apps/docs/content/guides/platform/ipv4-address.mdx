The add-on is $4 per month - we're passing on the AWS costs to you. The add-on is available for all paid plans.

## When is this add-on required?

This add-on is not required if any of these conditions are met

- you are only connecting to the database via Supavisor, our connection pooler, or via any of our client libraries.
- If you are connecting to the database directly and the network from which you are connecting to the database supports IPv6 addresses.

This add-on is only required if you are connecting to the database directly from an IPv6 incompatible network.

<Admonition type="note" label="Add-on has no impact on PGBouncer removal">

When you purchase this add-on, your project won't be migrated to IPv6. PGBouncer will still be removed for the project according to the timeline mentioned in [this discussion](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/17817);

</Admonition>

## Enabling the add-on

You can enable the IPv4 add-on in your project [add-on settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/addons) page.

<Admonition type="caution" label="Downtime when add-on is toggled.">
  Note that there might be some downtime when toggling the add-on since some DNS clients might have
  cached the old DNS entry and it might take some time for the updated DNS entry to be picked up.
  Generally, this should be less than a minute.
</Admonition>

## Read Replicas

When the IPv4 add-on is enabled, an IPv4 address is provisioned for each database in your project.

By default, this is only the Primary database for your project. If [Read replicas](/docs/guides/platform/read-replicas) are being used, each replica also gets its own IPv4 address, with a corresponding $4 charge.

## Caveats

For regular use-cases like a restart or compute size changes, the IPv4 address remains unchanged.
However, there are cases where maintaining the same IPv4 address isn't guaranteed. These include:

- If the project gets paused and unpaused
- If the add-on gets removed and added again
