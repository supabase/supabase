title: Available regions
---

Each Supabase project is deployed to one primary region. Choose the location closest to your users for the best performance.

## General regions

For most projects, we recommend choosing a general region. Supabase will deploy your project to an available AWS region within that area based on current infrastructure capacity.

Note: General regions aren’t yet supported for read replicas or management via the API.

## Specific regions

If you prefer, you can choose an exact AWS region for your project.
