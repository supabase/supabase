#### The payment for completing the subscription on the AWS Marketplace fails. What can I do?

For more information on payment errors, refer to the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/buyerguide/buyer-paying-for-products.html#payment-methods).

#### How can I enable the Spend Cap for my organization managed through the AWS Marketplace?

For organizations on the Pro Plan that are managed through the AWS Marketplace, the Spend Cap is not available.
In your AWS account, you can set up a budget for marketplace purchases (or for a specific marketplace product) and receive notifications once the budget is exceeded.

#### I want to cancel my AWS Marketplace subscription. How can I do this?

You can cancel your marketplace subscription within 48 hours of purchase. To do so, open a support ticket via the Supabase dashboard. After the 48-hour period, cancellation is no longer possible. If you cancel within the first 48 hours, the upfront charge for the fixed subscription fee will be refunded. Any usage costs incurred up to that point will not be refunded.

#### Does purchasing Supabase through the AWS Marketplace count toward my AWS spend commitment?

Yes, marketplace purchases do count toward the spend commitment.
