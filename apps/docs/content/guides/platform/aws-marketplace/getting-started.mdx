## Before you start

Depending on whether a Supabase organization is managed and billed through the AWS Marketplace or directly through the Supabase platform, there are differences. To help you make an informed decision about which approach is better suited for your needs, you can find an overview of these differences in the table below.

## Purchase Supabase through the AWS Marketplace

Purchasing Supabase through the AWS Marketplace involves two steps. First, you purchase the corresponding subscription on the marketplace. Then, to complete the setup, you must link this subscription to a Supabase organization on the Supabase platform.

For more details on completing the setup and what it means to link an organization, see our [Account Setup guide](./account-setup).

        Go to the [Supabase product page on the AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-zjciuce2qsb3q) and click "View purchase options".

      <StepHikeCompact.Details title="Configure the subscription" fullWidth>
        Select the desired plan (Pro Plan or Team Plan) and configure whether the subscription should automatically renew after one month.

        <Admonition type="danger">

          Disabling auto-renewal means that the subscription will be downgraded to the Free Plan after one month.

          If the downgrade causes you to exceed the [free projects limit](/docs/guides/platform/billing-on-supabase#free-plan), **all** projects within the organization will be paused. We do not make the decision about which projects continue to run and which are paused. You must then decide which projects you want to keep active and manually reactivate them through the Supabase dashboard.
