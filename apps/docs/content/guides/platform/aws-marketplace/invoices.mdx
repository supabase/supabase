## Where to find your invoices

You can view your invoices in the [AWS Billing and Cost Management console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/bills) under the "Bills" section.

## What invoices you get from AWS

You'll receive two invoices for your marketplace subscription.

### Invoice 1 - charge type "subscription"

- What for: The fixed subscription fee paid in advance
- When: At the time of subscription, and in subsequent months on the same day of the month the subscription was started

### Invoice 2 - charge type "usage"

- What for: Usage that exceeds the quota included in the plan, or usage not covered by the plan (e.g. Custom Domain add-on, IPv4 add-on, additionally provisioned Disk IOPS).
- When: No later than the third day of the month for the previous month. This is independent of your subscriptionâ€™s billing cycle and instead covers the period from the first to the last day of the previous month.

## More information

- Detailed explanations of how each usage item is billed, independent of the AWS Marketplace. Refer to the [Manage Your Usage guide](../manage-your-usage).
