Enterprise customers can use Account-based Billing to simplify billing for multiple organizations.

<Admonition type="note">This is for users considering or on Enterprise plan only.</Admonition>

## Account-based billing

By default, each organization has a subscription and a plan. For our Enterprise customers, we offer Account-based Billing, so multiple organizations can point to a single Enterprise subscription, further simplifying billing.

![Account-based Billing: Overview](/docs/img/guides/platform/account-based-billing.png)

With Account-based Billing, all organizations and projects within the subscription are recognized as Enterprise and your support tier or security addons propagate to all projects.

## Monitoring Enterprise usage

For the usage-billing, we’ll sum up the usage from all organizations and projects. You can still break down the usage per organization or per project by going to the [organization billing page](/dashboard/org/_/billing).

## Upgrading to the Enterprise plan

Account-based Billing is not self-serve. Please reach out to your customer success contact person to set this up.
