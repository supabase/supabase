## What you are charged for

You are charged for the number of distinct users who log in or refresh their token during the billing cycle using a SAML 2.0 compatible identity provider. Each unique user is counted only once per billing cycle, regardless of how many times they authenticate. These users are referred to as "SSO MAUs".

### Example

Your billing cycle runs from January 1 to January 31. Although User-1 was signed in multiple times, they are counted as a single SSO MAU for this billing cycle.

<StepHikeCompact>
  <StepHikeCompact.Step step={1}>
    <StepHikeCompact.Details title="Sign User-1 in on January 3" fullWidth>
      The SSO MAU count increases from 0 to 1.

      ```javascript
      const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithSSO({
      domain: 'company.com'
    })

      if (data?.url) {
      // redirect User-1 to the identity provider's authentication flow
      window.location.href = data.url
    }
      ```
    </StepHikeCompact.Details>

  </StepHikeCompact.Step>

{' '}

<StepHikeCompact.Step step={2}>
  <StepHikeCompact.Details title="Sign User-1 out on January 4" fullWidth>
    ```javascript const {error} = await supabase.auth.signOut() ```
  </StepHikeCompact.Details>
</StepHikeCompact.Step>

  <StepHikeCompact.Step step={3}>
    <StepHikeCompact.Details title="Sign User-1 in again on January 17" fullWidth>
      The SSO MAU count remains 1.

      ```javascript
      const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithSSO({
      domain: 'company.com'
    })

      if (data?.url) {
      // redirect User-1 to the identity provider's authentication flow
      window.location.href = data.url
    }
      ```
    </StepHikeCompact.Details>

  </StepHikeCompact.Step>
</StepHikeCompact>
