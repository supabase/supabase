## What you are charged for

You are charged for the number of distinct users who log in or refresh their token during the billing cycle using a SAML 2.0 compatible identity provider (e.g. Google Workspace, Microsoft Active Directory). Each unique user is counted only once per billing cycle, regardless of how many times they authenticate. These users are referred to as "SSO MAUs".

### Example

Your billing cycle runs from January 1 to January 31. Although User-1 was signed in multiple times, they are counted as a single SSO MAU for this billing cycle.

<StepHikeCompact>
  <StepHikeCompact.Step step={1}>
    <StepHikeCompact.Details title="Sign User-1 in on January 3" fullWidth>
      The SSO MAU count increases from 0 to 1.

      ```javascript
      const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithSSO({
      domain: 'company.com'
    })

      if (data?.url) {
      // redirect User-1 to the identity provider's authentication flow
      window.location.href = data.url
    }
      ```
    </StepHikeCompact.Details>

  </StepHikeCompact.Step>

{' '}

<StepHikeCompact.Step step={2}>
  <StepHikeCompact.Details title="Sign User-1 out on January 4" fullWidth>
    ```javascript

    const { error } = await supabase.auth.signOut()

    ```

  </StepHikeCompact.Details>
</StepHikeCompact.Step>

  <StepHikeCompact.Step step={3}>
    <StepHikeCompact.Details title="Sign User-1 in again on January 17" fullWidth>
      The SSO MAU count remains 1.

      ```javascript
      const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithSSO({
      domain: 'company.com'
    })

      if (data?.url) {
      // redirect User-1 to the identity provider's authentication flow
      window.location.href = data.url
    }
      ```
    </StepHikeCompact.Details>

  </StepHikeCompact.Step>
</StepHikeCompact>
