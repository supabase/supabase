## What you are charged for

You are charged for the number of distinct images transformed during the billing period, regardless of how many transformations each image undergoes. We refer to these images as "origin" images.

### Example

With these four transformations applied to `image-1.jpg` and `image-2.jpg`, the origin images count is 2.

```javascript
supabase.storage.from('bucket').createSignedUrl('image-1.jpg', 60000, {
  transform: {
    width: 200,
    height: 200,
  },
})
```

```javascript
supabase.storage.from('bucket').createSignedUrl('image-2.jpg', 60000, {
  transform: {
    width: 400,
    height: 300,
  },
})
```

```javascript
supabase.storage.from('bucket').createSignedUrl('image-2.jpg', 60000, {
  transform: {
    width: 600,
    height: 250,
  },
})
```

```javascript
supabase.storage.from('bucket').download('image-2.jpg', {
  transform: {
    width: 800,
    height: 300,
  },
})
```

## How charges are calculated

Storage Image Transformations are billed using Package pricing, with each package representing 1000 origin images. If your usage falls between two packages, you are billed for the next whole package.

### Example

For simplicity, let's assume a package size of 1,000 and a charge of $5 per package with no quota.

| Origin Images | Packages Billed | Costs |
| ------------- | --------------- | ----- |
| 999           | 1               | $5    |
| 1,000         | 1               | $5    |
| 1,001         | 2               | $10   |
| 1,500         | 2               | $10   |

## Billing examples

### Within quota

The organization's number of origin images for the billing cycle is within the quota, so no charges apply.

| Line Item             | Units            | Costs   |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | ------- |
| Pro Plan              | 1                | $25     |
| Compute Hours Micro   | 744 hours        | $10     |
| Image Transformations | 74 origin images | $0      |
| **Subtotal**          |                  | **$35** |
| Compute Credits       |                  | -$10    |
| **Total**             |                  | **$25** |

### Exceeding quota

The organization's number of origin images for the billing cycle exceeds the quota by 750, incurring charges for this additional usage.

| Line Item             | Units             | Costs   |
| --------------------- | ----------------- | ------- |
| Pro Plan              | 1                 | $25     |
| Compute Hours Micro   | 744 hours         | $10     |
| Image Transformations | 850 origin images | $5      |
| **Subtotal**          |                   | **$40** |
| Compute Credits       |                   | -$10    |
| **Total**             |                   | **$30** |

## View usage

You can view Storage Image Transformations usage on the [organization's usage page](https://supabase.com/dashboard/org/_/usage). The page shows the usage of all projects by default. To view the usage for a specific project, select it from the dropdown. You can also select a different time period.

In the Storage Image Transformations section, you can see how many origin images were transformed during the selected time period.

## Optimize usage

- Pre-generate common variants – instead of transforming images on the fly, generate and store commonly used sizes in advance
- Optimize original image sizes – upload images in an optimized format and resolution to reduce the need for excessive transformations
- Leverage [Smart CDN](/docs/guides/storage/cdn/smart-cdn) caching or any other caching solution to serve transformed images efficiently and avoid unnecessary repeated transformations
- Control how long assets are stored in the browser using the `Cache-Control` header
