## What you are charged for

You are charged for the number of distinct users who log in or refresh their token during the billing cycle. Each unique user is counted only once per billing cycle, regardless of how many times they authenticate. These users are referred to as "MAUs".

### Example

Your billing cycle runs from January 1 to January 31. Although User-1 was signed in multiple times, they are counted as a single MAU for this billing cycle.

<StepHikeCompact>
  <StepHikeCompact.Step step={1}>
    <StepHikeCompact.Details title="Sign User-1 in on January 3" fullWidth>
      The MAU count increases from 0 to 1.

      ```javascript
      const {data, error} = await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({
      email: 'user-1@email.com',
      password: 'example-password-1',
    })
      ```
    </StepHikeCompact.Details>

  </StepHikeCompact.Step>

{' '}

<StepHikeCompact.Step step={2}>
  <StepHikeCompact.Details title="Sign User-1 out on January 4" fullWidth>
    ```javascript const {error} = await supabase.auth.signOut() ```
  </StepHikeCompact.Details>
</StepHikeCompact.Step>

  <StepHikeCompact.Step step={3}>
    <StepHikeCompact.Details title="Sign User-1 in again on January 17" fullWidth>
      The MAU count remains 1.

      ```javascript
      const {data, error} = await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({
      email: 'user-1@email.com',
      password: 'example-password-1',
    })
      ```
    </StepHikeCompact.Details>

  </StepHikeCompact.Step>
</StepHikeCompact>
