## What you are charged for

You are charged for the number of times your functions get invoked, regardless of the response status code.

## How charges are calculated

Edge Function Invocations are billed using Package pricing, with each package representing 1 million invocations. If your usage falls between two packages, you are billed for the next whole package.

### Example

For simplicity, let's assume a package size of 1 million and a charge of $2 per package without a free quota.

| Invocations | Packages Billed | Costs |
| ----------- | --------------- | ----- |
| 999,999     | 1               | $2    |
| 1,000,000   | 1               | $2    |
| 1,000,001   | 2               | $4    |
| 1,500,000   | 2               | $4    |
