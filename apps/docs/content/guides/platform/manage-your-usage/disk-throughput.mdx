## What you are charged for

Each database has a dedicated disk, and you are charged for its provisioned disk throughput. However, unless you explicitly opt in for additional throughput, no charges apply.

Refer to our [disk guide](/docs/guides/platform/compute-and-disk#disk) for details on how disk throughput, disk IOPS, disk size, disk type and compute size interact, along with their limitations and constraints.

<Admonition type="note">

Launching a Read Replica creates an additional database with its own dedicated disk. Read Replicas inherit the primary database's disk throughput settings. You are charged for the provisioned throughput of the Read Replica.

</Admonition>

## How charges are calculated

Disk throughput is charged by Mbps-Hrs (Mbps stands for megabits per second). 1 Mbps-Hr represents disk throughput of 1 Mbps being provisioned for 1 hour. For example, having 10 Mbps provisioned for 5 hours results in 50 Mbps-Hrs (10 Mbps Ã— 5 hours).

### Usage on your invoice

Usage is shown as "Disk Throughput Mbps-Hrs" on your invoice.

## Pricing

Pricing depends on the [disk type](/docs/guides/platform/compute-and-disk#disk-types), with type gp3 being the default.

### General purpose disks (gp3)

$0.00013 per Mbps-Hr ($0.095 per Mbps per month). gp3 disks come with a baseline throughput of 125 Mbps. You are only charged for provisioned throughput exceeding these 125 Mbps.

| Plan       | Included Disk Throughput | Over-Usage per Mbps per month | Over-Usage per Mbps-Hrs |
| ---------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Pro        | 125 Mbps                 | $0.095                        | $0.00013                |
| Team       | 125 Mbps                 | $0.095                        | $0.00013                |
| Enterprise | Custom                   | Custom                        | Custom                  |

### High performance disks (io2)

There are no charges. Throughput scales with IOPS at no additional cost.
