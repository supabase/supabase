## What you are charged for

Each database has a dedicated [disk](/docs/guides/platform/compute-and-disk#disk). You are charged for the provisioned disk size.

<Admonition type="note">

Disk size is not relevant for the Free Plan. Instead Free Plan customers are limited by [Database size](/docs/guides/platform/database-size).

</Admonition>

## How charges are calculated

Disk size is charged by Gigabyte-Hours (GB-Hrs). 1 GB-Hr represents 1 GB being provisioned for 1 hour.
For example, having 10 GB provisioned for 5 hours results in 50 GB-Hrs (10 GB Ã— 5 hours).

### Usage on your invoice

Usage is shown as "Disk Size GB-Hrs" on your invoice.

## Pricing

Pricing depends on the [disk type](/docs/guides/platform/compute-and-disk#disk-types), with gp3 being the default disk type.

### General purpose disks (gp3)

$0.000171 per GB-Hr ($0.125 per GB per month). The primary database of your project gets provisioned with an 8 GB disk. You are only charged for provisioned disk size exceeding these 8 GB.

| Plan       | Included Disk Size | Over-Usage per GB per month | Over-Usage per GB-Hr |
| ---------- | ------------------ | --------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Pro        | 8 GB               | $0.125                      | $0.000171            |
| Team       | 8 GB               | $0.125                      | $0.000171            |
| Enterprise | Custom             | Custom                      | Custom               |

<Admonition type="note">

Launching a Read Replica creates an additional database with its own dedicated disk. You are charged from the first byte of provisioned disk for the Read Replica. Refer to [Manage Read Replica usage](/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/read-replicas) for details on billing.

</Admonition>

### High performance disks (io2)

$0.000267 per GB-Hr ($0.195 per GB per month).
Unlike general purpose disks, high performance disks are billed from the first byte of provisioned disk.

| Plan       | Included Disk size | Usage per GB per month | Usage per GB-Hr |
| ---------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- | --------------- |
| Pro        | 0 GB               | $0.195                 | $0.000267       |
| Team       | 0 GB               | $0.195                 | $0.000267       |
| Enterprise | Custom             | Custom                 | Custom          |

## Billing examples

### Gp3

Project 1 and 2 don't exceed the included disk size, so no charges for Disk size apply. Project 3 exceeds the included disk size by 42 GB, incurring charges for this additional usage.

## View usage

You can view Disk size usage on the [organization's usage page](https://supabase.com/dashboard/org/_/usage). The page shows the usage of all projects by default. To view the usage for a specific project, select it from the dropdown.
