## What you are charged for

Each database has a dedicated [disk](/docs/guides/platform/compute-and-disk#disk). You are charged for the provisioned disk size.

<Admonition type="note">

Disk size is not relevant for the Free Plan. Instead Free Plan customers are limited by [Database size](/docs/guides/platform/database-size).

</Admonition>

## How charges are calculated

Disk size is charged by Gigabyte-Hours (GB-Hrs). 1 GB-Hr represents 1 GB being provisioned for 1 hour.
For example, having 10 GB provisioned for 5 hours results in 50 GB-Hrs (10 GB × 5 hours).

### Usage on your invoice

Usage is shown as "Disk Size GB-Hrs" on your invoice.

## Pricing

Pricing depends on the [disk type](/docs/guides/platform/compute-and-disk#disk-types), with gp3 being the default disk type.

### General purpose disks (gp3)

<Price price="0.000171" /> per GB-Hr (<Price price="0.125" /> per GB per month). The primary
database of your project gets provisioned with an 8 GB disk. You are only charged for provisioned
disk size exceeding these 8 GB.

| Plan       | Included Disk Size | Over-Usage per GB per month | Over-Usage per GB-Hr       |
| ---------- | ------------------ | --------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Pro        | 8 GB               | <Price price="0.125" />     | <Price price="0.000171" /> |
| Team       | 8 GB               | <Price price="0.125" />     | <Price price="0.000171" /> |
| Enterprise | Custom             | Custom                      | Custom                     |

<Admonition type="note">

Launching a Read Replica creates an additional database with its own dedicated disk. You are charged from the first byte of provisioned disk for the Read Replica. Refer to [Manage Read Replica usage](/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/read-replicas) for details on billing.

</Admonition>

### High performance disks (io2)

<Price price="0.000267" /> per GB-Hr (<Price price="0.195" /> per GB per month). Unlike general
purpose disks, high performance disks are billed from the first byte of provisioned disk.

| Plan       | Included Disk size | Usage per GB per month  | Usage per GB-Hr            |
| ---------- | ------------------ | ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Pro        | 0 GB               | <Price price="0.195" /> | <Price price="0.000267" /> |
| Team       | 0 GB               | <Price price="0.195" /> | <Price price="0.000267" /> |
| Enterprise | Custom             | Custom                  | Custom                     |

## Billing examples

### Gp3

Project 1 and 2 don't exceed the included disk size, so no charges for Disk size apply. Project 3 exceeds the included disk size by 42 GB, incurring charges for this additional usage.

## View usage

You can view Disk size usage on the [organization's usage page](/dashboard/org/_/usage). The page shows the usage of all projects by default. To view the usage for a specific project, select it from the dropdown.

In the Disk size section, you can see how much disk size your projects have provisioned.
