## What you are charged for

You can configure [Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)](/docs/guides/platform/backups#point-in-time-recovery) for a project by enabling the [PITR add-on](/dashboard/project/_/settings/addons?panel=pitr). You are charged for every enabled PITR add-on across your projects.

## How charges are calculated

PITR is charged by the hour, meaning you are charged for the exact number of hours that PITR is active for a project. If PITR is active for part of an hour, you are still charged for the full hour.

### Example

Your billing cycle runs from January 1 to January 31. On January 10 at 4:30 PM, you activate PITR for your project. At the end of the billing cycle you are billed for 512 hours.

| Time Window                                 | PITR Activated | Hours Billed | Description         |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------- | ------------ | ------------------- |
| January 1, 00:00 AM - January 10, 4:00 PM   | No             | 0            |                     |
| January 10, 04:00 PM - January 10, 4:30 PM  | No             | 0            |                     |
| January 10, 04:30 PM - January 10, 5:00 PM  | Yes            | 1            | full hour is billed |
| January 10, 05:00 PM - January 31, 23:59 PM | Yes            | 511          |                     |

## Optimize usage

- Review your [backup frequency](/docs/guides/platform/backups#frequency-of-backups) needs to determine whether you require PITR or free Daily Backups are sufficient
- Regularly check your projects and disable PITR where no longer needed
- Consider disabling PITR for non-production databases
