## What you are charged for

Each [Preview branch](/docs/guides/deployment/branching) is a separate environment with all Supabase services (Database, Auth, Storage, etc.). You're charged for usage within that environment—such as [Compute](/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/compute), [Disk Size](/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/disk-size), [Egress](/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/egress), and [Storage](/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/storage-size)—just like the project you branched from.

Usage by Preview branches counts toward your subscription plan's quota.

## How charges are calculated

Refer to individual [usage items](/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage) for details on how charges are calculated. Branching charges are the sum of all these items.

### Usage on your invoice

Compute incurred by Preview branches is shown as "Branching Compute Hours" on your invoice. Other usage items are not shown separately for branches and are rolled up into the project.

## Pricing

## Billing examples

The project has a Preview branch "XYZ", that runs for 30 hours, incurring Compute and Egress costs. Disk Size usage remains within the 8 GB included in the subscription plan, so no additional charges apply.

## Optimize usage

- Merge Preview branches as soon as they are ready
- Delete Preview branches that are no longer in use
- Check whether your [persistent branches](/docs/guides/deployment/branching#persistent-branches) need to be defined as persistent, or if they can be ephemeral instead. Persistent branches will remain active even after the underlying PR is closed.
