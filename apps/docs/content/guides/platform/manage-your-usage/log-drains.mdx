## What you are charged for

You can configure log drains in the [project settings](/dashboard/project/_/settings/log-drains) to send logs to one or more destinations. You are charged for each log drain that is configured (referred to as [Log Drain Hours](/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/log-drains#log-drain-hours)), the log events sent (referred to as [Log Drain Events](/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/log-drains#log-drain-events)), and the [Egress](/docs/guides/platform/manage-your-usage/egress) incurred by the export—across all your projects.

## Log Drain Hours

### How charges are calculated

You are charged by the hour, meaning you are charged for the exact number of hours that a log drain is configured for a project. If a log drain is configured for part of an hour, you are still charged for the full hour.

#### Example

Your billing cycle runs from January 1 to January 31. On January 10 at 4:30 PM, you configure a log drain for your project. At the end of the billing cycle you are billed for 512 hours.

| Time Window                                 | Log Drain Configured | Hours Billed | Description         |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------ | ------------------- |
| January 1, 00:00 AM - January 10, 4:00 PM   | No                   | 0            |                     |
| January 10, 04:00 PM - January 10, 4:30 PM  | No                   | 0            |                     |
| January 10, 04:30 PM - January 10, 5:00 PM  | Yes                  | 1            | full hour is billed |
| January 10, 05:00 PM - January 31, 23:59 PM | Yes                  | 511          |                     |

#### Usage on your invoice

Usage is shown as "Log Drain Hours" on your invoice.

### Pricing

Log Drains are available as a project Add-On for all Team and Enterprise users. Each Log Drain costs <Price price="0.0822" /> per hour (<Price price="60" /> per month).

## Log Drain Events

### How charges are calculated

Log Drain Events are billed using Package pricing, with each package representing 1 million events. If your usage falls between two packages, you are billed for the next whole package.

#### Example

| Events    | Packages Billed | Costs                 |
| --------- | --------------- | --------------------- |
| 999,999   | 1               | <Price price="0.2" /> |
| 1,000,000 | 1               | <Price price="0.2" /> |
| 1,000,001 | 2               | <Price price="0.4" /> |
| 1,500,000 | 2               | <Price price="0.4" /> |

#### Usage on your invoice

Usage is shown as "Log Drain Events" on your invoice.

### Pricing

<Price price="0.2" /> per 1 million events.

## Billing example

The project has two log drains configured throughout the entire billing cycle with 800,000 and 1.6 million events each. In this example we assume that the organization is exceeding its Unified Egress Quota, so charges for Egress apply.
