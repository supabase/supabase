## What you are charged for

Realtime Peak Connections are measured by tracking the highest number of concurrent connections for each project during the billing cycle. Regardless of fluctuations, only the peak count per project is used for billing, and the totals from all projects are summed. Only successful connections are counted, connection attempts are not included.

### Example

For simplicity, this example assumes a billing cycle of only three days.

| Project   | Peak Connections Day 1 | Peak Connections Day 2 | Peak Connections Day 3 |
| --------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Project A | 80                     | 100                    | 90                     |
| Project B | 120                    | 110                    | 150                    |

**Total billed connections:** 100 (Project A) + 150 (Project B) = **250 connections**

## How charges are calculated

Realtime Peak Connections are billed using Package pricing, with each package representing 1,000 peak connections. If your usage falls between two packages, you are billed for the next whole package.

### Example

For simplicity, let's assume a package size of 1,000 and a charge of <Price price="10" /> per package with no quota.

| Peak Connections | Packages Billed | Costs                |
| ---------------- | --------------- | -------------------- |
| 999              | 1               | <Price price="10" /> |
| 1,000            | 1               | <Price price="10" /> |
| 1,001            | 2               | <Price price="20" /> |
| 1,500            | 2               | <Price price="20" /> |

## Billing examples

### Within quota

The organization's connections are within the quota, so no charges apply.

| Line Item                 | Units           | Costs                    |
| ------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------ |
| Pro Plan                  | 1               | <Price price="25" />     |
| Compute Hours Micro       | 744 hours       | <Price price="10" />     |
| Realtime Peak Connections | 350 connections | <Price price="0" />      |
| **Subtotal**              |                 | **<Price price="35" />** |
| Compute Credits           |                 | -<Price price="10" />    |
| **Total**                 |                 | **<Price price="25" />** |

### Exceeding quota

The organization's connections exceed the quota by 1,200, incurring charges for this additional usage.

| Line Item                 | Units             | Costs                    |
| ------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| Pro Plan                  | 1                 | <Price price="25" />     |
| Compute Hours Micro       | 744 hours         | <Price price="10" />     |
| Realtime Peak Connections | 1,700 connections | <Price price="20" />     |
| **Subtotal**              |                   | **<Price price="45" />** |
| Compute Credits           |                   | -<Price price="10" />    |
| **Total**                 |                   | **<Price price="35" />** |
