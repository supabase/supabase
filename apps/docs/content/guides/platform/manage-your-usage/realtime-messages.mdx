## What you are charged for

You are charged for the number of messages going through Supabase Realtime throughout the billing cycle. Includes database changes, Broadcast and Presence.

**Database changes**
Each database change counts as one message per client that listens to the event. For example, if a database change occurs and 5 clients listen to that database event, it counts as 5 messages.

**Broadcast**
Each broadcast message counts as one message sent plus one message per subscribed client that receives it. For example, if you broadcast a message and 4 clients listen to it, it counts as 5 messagesâ€”1 sent and 4 received.

## How charges are calculated

Realtime Messages are billed using Package pricing, with each package representing 1 million messages. If your usage falls between two packages, you are billed for the next whole package.

### Example

For simplicity, let's assume a package size of 1,000,000 and a charge of $2.50 per package without quota.

| Messages  | Packages Billed | Costs |
| --------- | --------------- | ----- |
| 999,999   | 1               | $2.50 |
| 1,000,000 | 1               | $2.50 |
| 1,000,001 | 2               | $5.00 |
| 1,500,000 | 2               | $5.00 |
