## What you are charged for

You are charged for the number of distinct users who log in or refresh their token during the billing cycle using a third-party authentication provider. Each unique user is counted only once per billing cycle, regardless of how many times they authenticate. These users are referred to as "Third-Party MAUs".

### Example

Your billing cycle runs from January 1 to January 31. Although User-1 was signed in multiple times, they are counted as a single SSO MAU for this billing cycle.

<StepHikeCompact>
  <StepHikeCompact.Step step={1}>
    <StepHikeCompact.Details title="User-1 signs in via Auth0 on January 3">
      The Third-Party MAU count increases
      from 0 to 1.
    </StepHikeCompact.Details>
