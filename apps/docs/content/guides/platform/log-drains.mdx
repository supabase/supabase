The following table lists the supported destinations and the required setup configuration:

| Destination        | Transport Method | Configuration                                     |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Generic Webhook    | HTTP             | URL <br /> HTTP Version <br/> Gzip <br /> Headers |
| Datadog            | HTTP             | API Key <br /> Region                             |
| Elastic - Filebeat | HTTP             | URL <br /> Username and Password                  |

### Destinations And Behavior

HTTP requests will be batched with a max of 250 items with at most 1 second intervals. Gzip compression will also be used if the 3rd party provider supports it.

#### Generic Webhook

Logs will be sent as a JSON payload. Both HTTP1 and HTTP2 are supported. A preset configuration of Headers can be supplied for all requests.

Note that requests will be **unsigned**.

:::note
Unsigned webhook requests are temporary and all requests will be signed in the near future.

#### Datadog

Logs sent to Datadog will have the name of the log source set on the `service` field of the event.

The payload message will be a stringified JSON of the raw log event, prefixed with the event timestamp.

#### Elastic - Filebeat

Logs will be sent to Filebeat server. See the [Filebeat documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-input-http_endpoint.html) on how to set up the Filebeat HTTP server.

The Filebeat server only handles HTTP1 requests. Basic Auth can be provided for optional user authentication.
