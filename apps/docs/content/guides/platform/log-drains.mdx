### Destinations And Behavior

HTTP requests are batched with a max of 250 items with at most 1 second intervals. Gzip compression will also be used if the 3rd party provider supports it.

#### Generic Webhook

Logs are sent as a JSON payload. Both HTTP1 and HTTP2 are supported. A preset configuration of Headers can be supplied for all requests.

Note that requests are **unsigned**.

:::note
Unsigned webhook requests are temporary and all requests are signed in the near future.

#### Datadog

Logs sent to Datadog have the name of the log source set on the `service` field of the event. The request body is gzipped.

The payload message are a stringified JSON of the raw log event, prefixed with the event timestamp.

#### Loki

Logs are sent to a provided HTTP endpoint, see [documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/reference/loki-http-api/#ingest-logs) for `POST /loki/api/v1/push`.

Events will get batched with multiple streams per request, with each log source having its own stream. The stream is labeled with the `source` key.

Requests are in the form of a gzipped JSON body. The payload message is a stringified JSON of the raw log event. No custom structured JSON metadata is attached to stream values. It is recommended that an `Authorization` header is used for authentication at the destination.

#### Elastic - Filebeat

Logs are sent to Filebeat server. See the [Filebeat documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-input-http_endpoint.html) on how to set up the Filebeat HTTP server.

The Filebeat server only handles HTTP1 requests. Basic Auth can be provided for optional user authentication.
