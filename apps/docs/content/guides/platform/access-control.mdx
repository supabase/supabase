description: 'Roles and permissions at the organization level'

Supabase provides granular access controls to manage permissions across your organizations.
For each organization, a member can have one of the following roles:

- Owner
- Administrator
- Developer

<Admonition type="note">

Additional roles (Read-only and Billing) are available on the [team and enterprise plans](https://supabase.com/pricing).

</Admonition>

A default organization is created when you first sign in, at which point you'll be assigned the **Owner** role. Keep in mind that members can access all projects within the organization and that project level access control is not available at this time. Create a separate organization if you need to restrict access to certain projects.

## Manage team members

To invite others to collaborate, visit your organization's team [settings](/dashboard/org/_/team) to send an invite link to another user's email. The invite expires after 24 hours.

<Admonition type="note">

Invites sent from a SAML SSO account can only be accepted by another SAML SSO account from the same identity provider. This is a security measure to prevent accidental invites to accounts not managed by your enterprise's identity provider.

### Transferring ownership of an organization

Each Supabase organization can have one or more owners. If you no longer want be an owner of an organization, click **Leave team** in your organization's team [settings](/dashboard/org/_/team). You can only leave an organization if there is _at least one other owner_. If you are transferring ownership of your organization to someone else, you will need to invite the new member with the **Owner** role. You can leave the organization after they've accepted the invitation.

### Permissions across roles [#permission-across-roles]

The table below shows the corresponding permissions for each available role you can assign a team member in the Dashboard.
