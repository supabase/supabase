You can migrate your users from Auth0 to Supabase Auth.

Changing authentication providers for a production app is an important operation. It can affect most aspects of your application. Prepare in advance by reading this guide, and develop a plan for handling the key migration steps and possible problems.

With advance planning, a smooth and safe Auth migration is possible.

## Before you begin

Before beginning, consider the answers to the following questions. They will help you need decide if you need to migrate, and which strategy to use:

- How do Auth provider costs scale as your user base grows?
- Does the new Auth provider provide all needed features? (for example, OAuth, password logins, Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA))
- Is downtime acceptable during the migration?
- What is your timeline to migrate before terminating the old Auth provider?

## Migration strategies

Depending on your evaluation, you may choose to go with one of the following strategies:

1. Rolling migration
2. One-off migration

## Migration steps

Auth provider migrations require 2 main steps:

1.  Export your user data from the old provider (Auth0)
1.  Import the data into your new provider (Supabase Auth)

### Step 1: Export your user data

Auth0 provides two methods for exporting user data:

1.  Use the [Auth0 data export feature](https://auth0.com/docs/troubleshoot/customer-support/manage-subscriptions/export-data)
1.  Use the [Auth0 management API](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/users/get-users). This endpoint has a rate limit, so you may need to export your users in several batches.

To export password hashes and MFA factors, contact Auth0 support.

### Step 2: Import your users into Supabase Auth

The steps for importing your users depends on the login methods that you support.

See the following sections for how to import users with:

- [Password-based login](#password-based-methods)
- [Passwordless login](#passwordless-methods)
- [OAuth](#oauth)

#### Password-based methods

For users who sign in with passwords, we recommend a hybrid approach to reduce downtime:

1.  For new users, use Supabase Auth for sign up.
1.  Migrate existing users in a one-off migration.

##### Sign up new users

Sign up new users using Supabase Auth's [signin methods](/docs/guides/auth/passwords#signing-up-with-an-email-and-password).

##### Migrate existing users to Supabase Auth

Migrate existing users to Supabase Auth. This requires two main steps: first, check which users need to be migrated, then create their accounts using the Supabase admin endpoints.

1.  Get your Auth 0 user export and password hash export lists.
1.  Filter for users who use password login.
    - Under the `identities` field in the user object, these users will have `auth0` as a provider. In the same identity object, you can find their Auth0 `user_id`.
    - Check that the user has a corresponding password hash by comapring their Auth0 `user_id` to the `oid` field in the password hash export.
1.  Use Supabase Auth's [admin create user](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-admin-createuser) method to recreate the user in Supabase Auth. If the user has a confirmed email address or phone number, set `email_confirm` or `phone_confirm` to `true`.

    ```ts
    const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.admin.createUser({
      email: 'foo@example.com',
      password_hash: '$2y$10$a9pghn27d7m0ltXvlX8LiOowy7XfFw0hW0G80OjKYQ1jaoejaA7NC',
      email_confirm: true,
    })
    ```

    <Admonition type="note" label="Supported password hashing algorithms">

    Supabase supports BCrypt and Argon2 password hashes.

    </Admonition>

    If you have a plaintext password instead of a hash, you can provide that instead. Supabase Auth will handle hashing the password for you. (Passwords are **always** stored hashed.)

    ```ts
    const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.admin.createUser({
      email: 'foo@example.com',
      password: 'supersecurepassword123!',
    })
    ```

1.  To sign in your migrated users, use the Supabase Auth [sign in methods](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signinwithpassword).

    To check for edge cases where users aren't successfully migrated, use a fallback strategy. This ensures that users can continue to sign in seamlessly:

    1.  Try to sign in the user with Supabase Auth.
    1.  If the signin fails, try to sign in with Auth0.
    1.  If Auth0 signin succeeds, call the admin create user method again to create the user in Supabase Auth.

#### Passwordless methods

For passwordless signin via email or phone, check for users with verified email addresses or phone numbers. Create these users in Supabase Auth with `email_confirm` or `phone_confirm` set to `true`:

```ts
const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.admin.createUser({
  email: 'foo@example.com',
  email_confirm: true,
})
```

Check your Supabase Auth [email configuration](/docs/guides/auth/auth-smtp) and configure your [email template](/dashboard/project/_/auth/templates) for use with magic links. See the [Email templates guide](/docs/guides/auth/auth-email-templates) to learn more.

Once you have imported your users, you can sign them in using the [`signInWithOtp`](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signinwithotp) method.

#### OAuth

Configure your OAuth providers in Supabase by following the [Social login guides](/docs/guides/auth/social-login).

For both new and existing users, sign in the user using the [`signInWithOAuth`](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signinwithoauth) method. This works without pre-migrating existing users, since the user always needs to sign in through the OAuth provider before being redirected to your service.

After the user has completed the OAuth flow successfully, you can check if the user is a new or existing user in Auth0 by mapping their social provider id to Auth0. Auth0 stores the social provider ID in the user ID, which has the format `provider_name|provider_id` (for example, `github|123456`). See the [Auth0 identity docs](https://auth0.com/docs/manage-users/user-accounts/identify-users) to learn more.

## Mapping between Auth0 and Supabase Auth

Each Auth provider has its own schema for tracking users and user information.

In Supabase Auth, your users are stored in your project's database under the `auth` schema. Every user has an identity (unless the user is an anonymous user), which represents the signin method they can use with Supabase. This is represented by the `auth.users` and `auth.identities` table.

See the [Users](/docs/guides/auth/users) and [Identities](/docs/guides/auth/identities) sections to learn more.

### Mapping user metadata and custom claims

Supabase Auth provides 2 fields which you can use to map user-specific metadata from Auth0:

- `auth.users.raw_user_meta_data` : For storing non-sensitive user metadata that the user can update (e.g full name, age, favorite color).
- `auth.users.raw_app_meta_data` : For storing non-sensitive user metadata that the user should not be able to update (e.g pricing plan, access control roles).

Both columns are accessible from the admin user methods. To create a user with custom metadata, you can use the following method:

```ts
const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.admin.createUser({
  email: 'foo@example.com',
  user_metadata: {
    full_name: 'Foo Bar',
  },
  app_metadata: {
    role: 'admin',
  },
})
```

<Admonition type="warning">

These fields will be exposed in the user's access token JWT so it is recommended not to store excessive metadata in these fields.

</Admonition>

These fields are stored as columns in the `auth.users` table using the `jsonb` type. Both fields can be updated by using the admin [`updateUserById` method](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-admin-updateuserbyid). If you want to allow the user to update their own `raw_user_meta_data` , you can use the [`updateUser` method](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-updateuser).

If you have a lot of user-specific metadata to store, it is recommended to create your own table in a private schema that uses the user id as a foreign key:

```sql
create table private.user_metadata (
	id int generated always as identity,
	user_id uuid references auth.users(id) on delete cascade,
	user_metadata jsonb
);
```

All users stored in Supabase Auth use the UUID V4 format as the ID. If your UUID format is identical, you can specify it in the admin create user method like this:

<Admonition type="note">

New users in Supabase Auth will always be created with a UUID V4 ID by default.

```ts
// specify a custom id
const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.admin.createUser({

Supabase Auth never stores passwords as plaintext. Since Supabase Auth supports reading BCrypt and argon2 password hashes, you can import your users passwords if they use the same hashing algorithm. New users in Supabase Auth who use password-based sign-in methods will always use a BCrypt hash. Passwords are stored in the `auth.users.encrypted_password` column.

<AccordionItem
header={<span className="text-foreground">My users have multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled, how do I make sure they don't have to set up MFA again?</span>}
id="mfa"

You can obtain an export of your users' MFA secrets by opening a support ticket with Auth0, similar to obtaining the export for password hashes. Supabase Auth only supports time-based one-time passwords (TOTP). Users who have TOTP-based factors may need to re-enroll using their choice of TOTP-based authenticator instead (e.g. 1Password / Google authenticator).

Customers may need to link their identity provider with Supabase Auth separately, but their users should still be able to sign-in as per-normal after authenticating with their identity provider. For more information about SSO with SAML 2.0, you can check out [this guide](/docs/guides/auth/enterprise-sso/auth-sso-saml). If you want to migrate your existing SAML SSO connections from Auth0 to Supabase Auth, please reach out to us via support.
