Any [Platform API](/docs/reference/api/introduction) or [dashboard](/dashboard) actions performed by organization members are logged automatically for auditing and security purposes. This includes actions such as creating a new project, inviting members, modifying an edge function or changing project settings.

Besides platform audit logs, Supabase Auth also provides [Auth Audit Logs](/docs/guides/auth/audit-logs) to monitor authentication-related activities within your projects.

Platform Audit Logs are only available on the [Team and Enterprise plans](/pricing).
