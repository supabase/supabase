# Compliance

Supabase is SOC 2 Type 2 compliant and regularly audited. All projects at Supabase are governed by the same set of compliance controls.

The [HIPAA Compliance Guide](/docs/guides/security/hipaa-compliance) explains Supabase's HIPAA responsibilities. Additional [security and compliance controls](/docs/guides/deployment/shared-responsibility-model#managing-healthcare-data) for projects that deal with electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI) and require HIPAA compliance are available through the HIPAA add-on.
