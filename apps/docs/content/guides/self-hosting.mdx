Self-hosted Supabase lets you run the entire Supabase stack on your own computer, server, or cloud infrastructure.

This is different from:

- **Supabase CLI / Local Development**: A lightweight [local environment](/docs/guides/local-development) for development and testing only.
- **Managed Supabase** platform: If you want to try managed Supabase for free, visit [supabase.com/dashboard](/dashboard).

Self-hosting is a good fit if you need full control over your data, have compliance requirements that prevent using managed services, or want to run Supabase in an isolated environment.

## No telemetry

Self-hosted Supabase does not phone home or collect any telemetry.

## Enterprise

If you're an enterprise using self-hosted Supabase, we'd love to hear from you. Reach out to our [Growth Team](https://forms.supabase.com/enterprise) to discuss your use case, share feedback, or explore design partnership opportunities.

## Community supported

There are several community-driven projects to help you deploy Supabase. These projects may be outdated and are seeking active maintainers. If you're interested in maintaining one of these projects, [contact the community team](/open-source/contributing/supasquad).

<div className="grid md:grid-cols-12 gap-4 not-prose">
  {community.map((x) => (
    <div className="md:col-span-6 xl:col-span-3" key={x.href}>
