We've curated a selection of prompts to help you work with Supabase using your favorite AI-powered IDE tools, such as GitHub Copilot or Cursor.

## How to use

Copy the prompt to a file in your repo.

Use the "include file" feature from your AI tool to include the prompt when chatting with your AI assistant. For example, with GitHub Copilot, use `#<filename>`, in Cursor, use `@Files`, and in Zed, use `/file`.
