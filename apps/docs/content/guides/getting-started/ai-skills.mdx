Agent Skills are modular packages that extend AI assistants with specialized knowledge, workflows, and best practices for specific domains.

## What are Skills?

Skills provide AI-powered development tools with:
- Specialized workflows for specific domains
- Best practices and optimization rules
- Domain expertise and patterns
- Procedural knowledge for complex tasks

Unlike prompts (which are conversation-level instructions for one-off tasks), Skills load on-demand and provide reusable, filesystem-based resources that transform general-purpose agents into specialists.
