## Feature status

Supabase Features are in 4 different states - Private Alpha, Public Alpha, Beta and Generally Available.

### Private Alpha

Features are initially launched as a private alpha to gather feedback from the community. To join our early access program, send an email to product-ops@supabase.io.

### Public Alpha

he alpha stage indicates that the API might change in the future, not that the service isn’t stable. Even though the [uptime Service Level Agreement](https://supabase.com/sla) does not cover products in Alpha, we do our best to have the service as stable as possible.

### Beta

Features in Beta are tested by an external penetration tester for security issues. The API is guaranteed to be stable and there is a strict communication process for breaking changes.

### Generally Available

In addition to the Beta requirements, features in GA are covered by the [uptime SLA](https://supabase.com/sla).
