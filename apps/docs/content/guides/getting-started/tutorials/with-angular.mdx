## Building the app

Start with building the Angular app from scratch.

### Initialize an Angular app

You can use the [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli) to initialize an app called `supabase-angular`.
The command sets some defaults, that you change to suit your needs:

```bash
npx ng new supabase-angular --routing false --style css --standalone false --ssr false
cd supabase-angular
```

Then, install the only additional dependency: [supabase-js](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js)

```bash
npm install @supabase/supabase-js
```

Finally, save the environment variables in a new `src/environments/environment.ts` file.
You need to create the `src/environments` directory first.
All you need are the API URL and the key that you copied [earlier](#get-api-details).
The application exposes these variables in the browser, and that's fine as you have [Row Level Security](/docs/guides/auth#row-level-security) enabled on the Database.

<$CodeSample
  path="/user-management/angular-user-management/src/environments/environment.ts"
<$CodeTabs>

<$CodeSample
  path="/user-management/angular-user-management/src/app/avatar/avatar.component.ts"
  lines={[[1, -1]]}
  meta="name=src/app/avatar/avatar.component.ts"
  language="typescript"
/>

<$CodeSample
  path="/user-management/angular-user-management/src/app/avatar/avatar.component.html"
  lines={[[1, -1]]}
  meta="name=src/app/avatar/avatar.component.html"
/>

</$CodeTabs>

### Launch!

Now you have all the components in place, update `AppComponent`:

<$CodeTabs>

<$CodeSample
  path="/user-management/angular-user-management/src/app/app.component.ts"
  lines={[[1, -1]]}
  meta="name=src/app/app.component.ts"
/>

<$CodeSample
  path="/user-management/angular-user-management/src/app/app.component.html"
  lines={[[1, -1]]}
  meta="name=src/app/app.component.html"
/>

</$CodeTabs>

You also need to change `app.module.ts` to include the `ReactiveFormsModule` from the `@angular/forms` package.

<$CodeSample
  path="/user-management/angular-user-management/src/app/app.module.ts"
  lines={[[1, -1]]}
  meta="name=src/app/app.module.ts"
/>

Once that's done, run the application in a terminal:

```bash
npm run start
```

Open the browser to [localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) and you should see the completed app.

At this stage you have a fully functional application!
