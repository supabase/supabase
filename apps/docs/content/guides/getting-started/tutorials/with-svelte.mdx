## Building the app

Start building the Svelte app from scratch.

### Initialize a Svelte app

You can use the Vite Svelte TypeScript Template to initialize an app called `supabase-svelte`:

```bash
npm create vite@latest supabase-svelte -- --template svelte-ts
cd supabase-svelte
npm install
```

Install the only additional dependency: [supabase-js](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js)

```bash
npm install @supabase/supabase-js
```

Finally, save the environment variables in a `.env`.
All you need are the API URL and the `anon` key that you copied [earlier](#get-the-api-keys).

<$CodeTabs>

```bash name=.env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_URL
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
```

</$CodeTabs>

Now you have the API credentials in place, create a helper file to initialize the Supabase client. These variables will be exposed on the browser, and that's fine since you have [Row Level Security](/docs/guides/auth#row-level-security) enabled on the Database.

<$CodeSample
path="user-management/svelte-user-management/src/supabaseClient.ts"
meta="name=src/supabaseClient.ts"
/>

### App styling (optional)

Optionally, update the CSS file `src/app.css` to make the app look nice.
You can find the full contents of this file [on GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/supabase/supabase/master/examples/user-management/svelte-user-management/src/app.css).

### Set up a login component

Set up a Svelte component to manage logins and sign ups. It uses Magic Links, so users can sign in with their email without using passwords.

<$CodeSample
path="user-management/svelte-user-management/src/lib/Auth.svelte"
meta="name=src/lib/Auth.svelte"
/>

### Account page

After a user is signed in, allow them to edit their profile details and manage their account.
Create a new component for that called `Account.svelte`.

<$CodeSample  
path="/user-management/svelte-user-management/src/lib/Account.svelte"
lines={[[1, 4], [7, 11], [14, 33], [34,53], [55,73], [75,-1]]}
meta="src/lib/Account.svelte"
/>

### Launch!

Now that you have all the components in place, update `App.svelte`:

<$CodeSample
path="user-management/svelte-user-management/src/App.svelte"
meta="name=src/App.svelte"
/>

Once that's done, run this in a terminal window:

```bash
npm run dev
```

And then open the browser to [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) and you should see the completed app.

<Admonition type="tip">

Svelte uses Vite and the default port is `5173`, Supabase uses `port 3000`. To change the redirection port for Supabase go to: **Authentication > URL Configuration** and change the **Site URL** to `http://localhost:5173/`

## Bonus: Profile photos

Every Supabase project is configured with [Storage](/docs/guides/storage) for managing large files like photos and videos.

### Create an upload widget

Create an avatar for the user so that they can upload a profile photo. Start by creating a new component:

<$CodeSample
path="user-management/svelte-user-management/src/lib/Avatar.svelte"
meta="name=src/lib/Avatar.svelte"
/>

### Add the new widget

And then you can add the widget to the Account page:

<$CodeSample  
path="/user-management/svelte-user-management/src/lib/Account.svelte"
lines={[[1,1], [5,5], [71,73], [74,74], [92,-1]]}
meta="src/lib/Account.svelte"
/>

At this stage you have a fully functional application!
