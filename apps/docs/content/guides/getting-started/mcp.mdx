The [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) (MCP) is a standard for connecting Large Language Models (LLMs) to external services.

This guide covers how to connect Supabase to the following AI tools using MCP:

- [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/)
- [Windsurf](https://docs.codeium.com/windsurf) (Codium)
- [Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline) (VS Code extension)
- [Claude desktop](https://claude.ai/download)
- [Claude code](https://claude.ai/code)

Once connected, you can use natural language commands to run read-only database queries in the AI tool.

## Connect to Supabase using MCP

Supabase uses the [Postgres MCP server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/postgres) to provide MCP access to your database. The MCP server runs all queries as read-only transactions.

### Step 1: Find your database connection string

To get started, you will need to retrieve your database connection string. These will differ depending on whether you are using a hosted or local instance of Supabase.

#### For a hosted Supabase instance

<ProjectConfigVariables variable="sessionPooler" />

Log in and choose a project above to find your connection string, or find it in the Dashboard:

1. Navigating to your project's [Connection settings](/dashboard/project/_/settings/database?showConnect=true)
1. Copying the connection string found under **Session pooler**.

Be sure to replace `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` with your database password.

#### For a local Supabase instance

When running a local instance of Supabase via the [CLI](/docs/reference/cli/introduction), you can find your connection string by running:

```shell
supabase status
```

or if you are using `npx`:

```shell
npx supabase status
```

This will output a list of details about your local Supabase instance. Copy the `DB URL` field in the output.

### Step 2: Configure in your AI tool

MCP compatible tools can connect to Supabase using the [Postgres MCP server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/postgres). Below are instructions on to connect to the Postgres MCP server using popular AI tools:

#### Cursor

1.  Open Cursor and create a `.cursor` directory in your project root if it doesn't exist.
1.  Create a `.cursor/mcp.json` file if it doesn't exist and open it.
1.  Add the following configuration:

    <$Partial path="mcp_config.mdx" variables={{ "app": "Cursor" }} />

1.  Save the configuration file.

1.  Open Cursor and navigate to **Settings/MCP**. You should see a green active status after the server is successfully connected.

#### Windsurf

1. Open Windsurf and navigate to the Cascade assistant.
1. Tap on the hammer (MCP) icon, then **Configure** to open the configuration file.
1. Add the following configuration:

   <$Partial path="mcp_config.mdx" variables={{ "app": "Windsurf" }} />

1. Save the configuration file and reload by tapping **Refresh** in the Cascade assistant.

1. You should see a green active status after the server is successfully connected.

#### Cline

1. Open the Cline extension in VS Code and tap the **MCP Servers** icon.
1. Tap **Configure MCP Servers** to open the configuration file.
1. Add the following configuration:

   <$Partial path="mcp_config.mdx" variables={{ "app": "VS Code" }} />

1. Save the configuration file. Cline should automatically reload the configuration.

1. You should see a green active status after the server is successfully connected.

#### Claude desktop

1. Open Claude desktop and navigate to **Settings**.
1. Under the **Developer** tab, tap **Edit Config** to open the configuration file.
1. Add the following configuration:

   <$Partial path="mcp_config.mdx" variables={{ "app": "Claude desktop" }} />

1. Save the configuration file and restart Claude desktop.

1. From the new chat screen, you should see a hammer (MCP) icon appear with the new MCP server available.

#### Claude code

1. Create a `.mcp.json` file in your project root if it doesn't exist.
1. Add the following configuration:

   <$Partial path="mcp_config.mdx" variables={{ "app": "Claude code" }} />

1. Save the configuration file.

1. Restart Claude code to apply the new configuration.
