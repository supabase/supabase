The [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) (MCP) is a standard for connecting Large Language Models (LLMs) to platforms like Supabase. This guide covers how to connect Supabase to the following AI tools using MCP:

- [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/)
- [Windsurf](https://docs.codeium.com/windsurf) (Codium)
- [Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline) (VS Code extension)
- [Claude desktop](https://claude.ai/download)
- [Claude code](https://claude.ai/code)

Once connected, your AI assistants can interact with and query your Supabase projects on your behalf.

## Step 1: Create a personal access token (PAT)

First, go to your [Supabase settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/account/tokens) and create a personal access token. Give it a name that describes its purpose, like "Cursor MCP Server". This will be used to authenticate the MCP server with your Supabase account.

## Step 2: Configure in your AI tool

MCP compatible tools can connect to Supabase using the [Supabase MCP server](https://github.com/supabase-community/supabase-mcp). Below are instructions for connecting to this server using popular AI tools:

### Cursor

1.  Open Cursor and create a `.cursor` directory in your project root if it doesn't exist.
1.  Create a `.cursor/mcp.json` file if it doesn't exist and open it.
1.  Add the following configuration:

<$Partial path="mcp_supabase_config.mdx" variables={{ "app": "Cursor" }} />

1.  Save the configuration file.

1.  Open Cursor and navigate to **Settings/MCP**. You should see a green active status after the server is successfully connected.

### Windsurf

1. Open Windsurf and navigate to the Cascade assistant.
1. Tap on the hammer (MCP) icon, then **Configure** to open the configuration file.
1. Add the following configuration:

<$Partial path="mcp_supabase_config.mdx" variables={{ "app": "Windsurf" }} />

1. Save the configuration file and reload by tapping **Refresh** in the Cascade assistant.

1. You should see a green active status after the server is successfully connected.

### Cline

1. Open the Cline extension in VS Code and tap the **MCP Servers** icon.
1. Tap **Configure MCP Servers** to open the configuration file.
1. Add the following configuration:

<$Partial path="mcp_supabase_config.mdx" variables={{ "app": "VS Code" }} />

1. Save the configuration file. Cline should automatically reload the configuration.

1. You should see a green active status after the server is successfully connected.

### Claude desktop

1. Open Claude desktop and navigate to **Settings**.
1. Under the **Developer** tab, tap **Edit Config** to open the configuration file.
1. Add the following configuration:

<$Partial path="mcp_supabase_config.mdx" variables={{ "app": "Claude desktop" }} />

1. Save the configuration file and restart Claude desktop.

1. From the new chat screen, you should see a hammer (MCP) icon appear with the new MCP server available.

### Claude code

1. Create a `.mcp.json` file in your project root if it doesn't exist.
1. Add the following configuration:

<$Partial path="mcp_supabase_config.mdx" variables={{ "app": "Claude code" }} />

1. Save the configuration file.

1. Restart Claude code to apply the new configuration.

### Enabling MCP in VSCode

VSCode supports MCP out of the box in its latest release. Follow these steps to enable MCP in VSCode:

Install the Latest Version of VSCode:

Ensure you have the latest version of VSCode installed. You can download it from the official VSCode website.
Configure MCP in VSCode:

Create a .vscode/mcp.json file in your workspace:

                {
                  "servers": [
                        {
                          "name": "Supabase MCP Server",
                          "url": "http://localhost:3000"
                        }
                              ]
                }

Alternatively, you can add the MCP server configuration through the VSCode Command Palette:
Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P on macOS).
Type MCP: Add Server and follow the prompts to add your MCP server.
Verify MCP Configuration:

Ensure that the MCP server is running and accessible.
Use the VSCode Command Palette to interact with the MCP server and verify that it is working correctly.

### Next steps

Your AI tool is now connected to Supabase using MCP. Try asking your AI assistant to create a new project, create a table, or fetch project config.
