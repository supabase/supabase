## Concepts

There are several concepts and terminology that is useful to understand how Realtime works.

- **Channels**: the foundation of Realtime. Think of them as rooms where clients can communicate and listen to events. Channels are identified by a topic name and if they are public or private.
- **Topics**: the name of the channel. They are used to identify the channel and are a string used to identify the channel.
- **Events**: the type of messages that can be sent and received.
- **Payload**: the actual data that is sent and received and that the user will act upon.
- **Concurrent Connections**: number of total channels subscribed for all clients.

## Channels

Channels are the foundation of Realtime. Think of them as rooms where clients can communicate and listen to events. Channels are identified by a topic name and if they are public or private.

For private channels, you need to use [Realtime Authorization](/docs/guides/realtime/authorization) to control access to the channel and if they are able to send messages.
For public channels, any user can subscribe to the channel, send and receive messages.

You can set your project to use only private channels or both private and public channels in the [Realtime Settings](/docs/guides/realtime/settings).

To note that if you have a private channel and a public channel with the same topic name, they will be seen as unique channels and messages won't be able to be sent between them.

## Database resources

Realtime uses several resources from your database to work properly. You need to ensure that your database has the following resources:

### Database connections

Realtime uses several database connections to do several operations. Some of them, as a user, you are able to tune them.

The connections are:

- **Migrations**: Temporarily two connections when we need to run database migrations
- **Authorization**: Configurable connection pool to check authorization policies on join
- **Postgres Changes**: 3 connection pools required
  - **Subscription management**: To manage the subscribers to Postgres Changes
  - **Subscription cleanup**: To cleanup the subscribers to Postgres Changes
  - **WAL pull**: To pull the changes from the database

The number of connections varies based on the instance size and your configuration.

### Replication slots

Realtime also uses, at maximum, 2 replication slots.

- **Broadcast from database**: To broadcast the changes from the database to the clients
- **Postgres Changes**: To listen to changes from the database

### Schema and tables

On the `realtime` schema we will create the following tables:

- `schema_migrations` - To track the migrations that have been run on the database from Realtime
- `subscription` - Track the subscribers to Postgres Changes
- `messages` - Partitioned table per day that's used for Authorization and Broadcast from database
  - **Authorization**: To check the authorization policies on join by checking if a given client can read and write to this table
  - **Broadcast from database**: Replication slot tracks a publication to this table to broadcast the changes to the clients

Realtime has a cleanup process that will delete tables older than 3 days.

### Functions

Realtime creates two functions on your database:

- `realtime.send` - Inserts an entry into `realtime.messages` table that will trigger the replication slot to broadcast the changes to the clients. It also captures errors to prevent the trigger from breaking.
- `realtime.broadcast_changes` - uses `realtime.send` to broadcast the changes with a format that is compatible with Postgres Changes
