## Connected clients

The Connected Clients report helps you monitor the total number of concurrent Realtime client connections to your project over time. This metric is essential for understanding your application's connection usage patterns and identifying when you're approaching your plan's connection limits.

The report displays the total number of connected Realtime clients, showing how connection counts fluctuate throughout the selected time period. Each client connection represents an active WebSocket connection to your Realtime service, which can subscribe to multiple channels for receiving real-time updates.

## Broadcast Events

The Broadcast Events report helps you monitor the volume of broadcast messages sent through your Realtime channels over time. This metric is essential for understanding your application's real-time messaging patterns and identifying when you're approaching your plan's message throughput limits.

The report displays the total number of broadcast events sent by clients, showing message volume throughout the selected time period. Broadcast events are low-latency messages sent between users using Realtime's pub/sub pattern, which can be sent from client libraries, REST APIs, or directly from your database. Each event represents a message broadcast to subscribers of a specific channel topic.

## Presence Events

The Presence Events report helps you monitor the volume of presence state updates sent through your Realtime channels over time. This metric is essential for understanding how your application tracks and synchronizes shared state between users, such as online status, user activity, or custom state information.

The report displays the total number of presence events sent by clients, showing state synchronization activity throughout the selected time period. Presence events occur when clients `track`, `update`, or `untrack` their presence state in a channel, triggering `sync`, `join`, or `leave` events. Unlike broadcast messages, presence state is persisted in the channel so new joiners immediately receive the current state without waiting for other users to send updates.

## Postgres Changes Events

The Postgres Changes Events report helps you monitor the volume of database change events (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) sent to your Realtime clients over time. This metric is essential for understanding how your application processes database changes and identifying potential performance bottlenecks or scaling issues.

The report displays the total number of Postgres change events received by clients, showing database change activity throughout the selected time period. Postgres Changes use logical replication to stream database changes from the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) to subscribed clients. Each event represents a database change that has been broadcast to clients subscribed to the relevant schema and table. Note that Postgres Changes process changes on a single thread to maintain order, which can create bottlenecks at scale compared to Broadcast.

## Rate of Channel joins

The Rate of Channel Joins report helps you monitor how quickly clients are joining Realtime channels over time. This metric is essential for understanding your application's channel subscription patterns and identifying when you're approaching your plan's channel join rate limits.

The report displays the rate of channel joins per second, showing how frequently clients subscribe to channels throughout the selected time period. A channel join occurs whenever a client subscribes to a channel topic to receive real-time updates. Each client connection can join multiple channels (up to 100 per connection for most plans), and the join rate measures how many of these subscriptions happen per second across your entire project.

## Message payload size

The Message Payload Size report helps you monitor the median size of message payloads sent through your Realtime channels over time. This metric is essential for understanding how message size impacts performance, latency, and bandwidth usage in your real-time application.

The report displays the median payload size in bytes, showing how message sizes fluctuate throughout the selected time period. Payload size directly affects message throughput and latency—larger payloads require more bandwidth and processing time, which can increase latency and reduce the number of messages your system can handle per second. Monitoring this metric helps you optimize your message structure and identify opportunities to reduce payload sizes for better performance.

## Broadcast from database replication lag

The Broadcast from Database Replication Lag report helps you monitor the median time between when a message is committed to your database and when it's broadcast to Realtime clients. This metric is essential for understanding the latency introduced by the database replication process when using broadcast from database.

The report displays the median replication lag in milliseconds, showing the delay between database commit and broadcast throughout the selected time period. When you use broadcast from database (by inserting messages into `realtime.messages`), Realtime reads changes from the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) using logical replication. The lag represents the time it takes for these changes to be processed and broadcast to subscribed clients. Higher lag values indicate delays in the replication pipeline, which can impact the real-time responsiveness of your application.

## (Read)Private Channel subscription RLS execution time

The (Read)Private Channel Subscription RLS Execution Time report helps you monitor the median time it takes to execute Row Level Security (RLS) policies when users subscribe to private channels. This metric is essential for understanding how RLS policy complexity impacts channel join latency and overall connection performance.

The report displays the median RLS execution time in milliseconds, showing how long it takes to validate user permissions when subscribing to private channels throughout the selected time period. When a user joins a private channel, Realtime checks RLS policies on the `realtime.messages` table to determine if the user has read access. This authorization check happens once per channel subscription and the result is cached for the duration of the connection. However, complex RLS policies with joins, function calls, or missing indexes can significantly increase this initial connection time.

## (Write)Private Channel subscription RLS execution time

The (Write)Private Channel Subscription RLS Execution Time report helps you monitor the median time it takes to execute Row Level Security (RLS) policies when users publish messages to private channels. This metric is essential for understanding how RLS policy complexity impacts message publishing latency and overall broadcast performance.

The report displays the median RLS execution time in milliseconds, showing how long it takes to validate user permissions when publishing to private channels throughout the selected time period. When a user sends a broadcast message to a private channel, Realtime checks RLS policies on the `realtime.messages` table to determine if the user has write (INSERT) access. This authorization check happens for the first message sent and then it's cached. Complex RLS policies with joins, function calls, or missing indexes can significantly increase first message publishing latency.
