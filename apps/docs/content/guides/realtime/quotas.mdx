Our cluster supports millions of concurrent connections and message throughput for production workloads.

<Admonition type="note">

Upgrade your plan to increase your quotas. Without a spend cap, or on an Enterprise plan, some quotas are still in place to protect budgets. All quotas are configurable per project. [Contact support](https://supabase.com/dashboard/support/new) if you need your quotas increased.

Beyond the Free and Pro plan you can customize your quotas by [contacting support](https://supabase.com/dashboard/support/new).

## Quota errors

When you exceed a quota, errors will appear in the backend logs and client-side messages in the WebSocket connection.

- **Logs**: check the [Realtime logs](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/database/realtime-logs) inside your project Dashboard.
- **Websocket errors**: Use your browser's developer tools to find the WebSocket initiation request and view individual messages.

<Admonition type="tip" label="Realtime Inspector">

You can use the [Realtime Inspector](https://realtime.supabase.com/inspector/new) to reproduce an error and share those connection details with Supabase support.

Some quotas can cause a Channel join to be refused. Realtime will reply with one of the following WebSocket messages:

### `too_many_channels`

Too many channels currently joined for a single client.

### `too_many_connections`

Too many total concurrent connections for a project.

### `too_many_joins`

Too many Channel joins per second.

### `tenant_events`

Clients will be disconnected if your project is generating too many messages per second. `supabase-js` will reconnect automatically when the message throughput decreases below your plan quota. An `event` is a WebSocket message delivered to, or sent from a client.

## Postgres changes payload quota

When this quota is reached, the `new` and `old` record payloads only include the fields with a value size of less than or equal to 64 bytes.
