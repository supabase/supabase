Let's explore how to implement Realtime Broadcast to send messages between clients using either WebSockets, REST API or triggers from your database.

## Usage

You can use the Supabase client libraries to send and receive Broadcast messages.

### Initialize the client

Go to your Supabase project's [API Settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/api) and grab the `URL` and `anon` public API key.

### Listening to broadcast messages

You can provide a callback for the `broadcast` channel to receive message. This example will receive any `broadcast` messages in `room-1`:

You can pass configuration options while initializing the Supabase Client.

Use this to guarantee that the server has received the message before resolving `channelD.send`'s promise. If the `ack` config is not set to `true` when creating the channel, the promise returned by `channelD.send` will resolve immediately.

### Send messages using REST calls

You can also send a Broadcast message by making an HTTP request to Realtime servers. This is useful when you want to send messages from your server or client without having to first establish a WebSocket connection.

## Trigger broadcast messages from your database

<Admonition type="caution">

This feature is currently in Public Alpha. If you have any issues [submit a support ticket](https://supabase.help).

</Admonition>

### How it works

Broadcast Changes allows you to trigger messages from your database. To achieve it Realtime is directly reading your WAL (Write Append Log) file using a publication against the `realtime.messages` table so whenever a new insert happens a message is sent to connected users.

It uses partitioned tables per day which allows the deletion your previous messages in a performant way by dropping the physical tables of this partitioned table. Tables older than 3 days old are deleted.

Broadcasting from the database works like a client-side broadcast, using WebSockets to send JSON packages. [Realtime Authorization](/docs/guides/realtime/authorization) is required and enabled by default to protect your data.

The database broadcast feature provides two functions to help you send messages:

- `realtime.send` will insert a message into realtime.messages without a specific format.
- `realtime.broadcast_changes` will insert a message with the required fields to emit database changes to clients. This helps you set up triggers on your tables to emit changes.

### Broadcasting a message from your database

The `realtime.send` function provides the most flexibility by allowing you to broadcast messages from your database without a specific format. This allows you to use database broadcast for messages that aren't necessarily tied to the shape of a Postgres row change.

```sql
SELECT realtime.send (
	to_jsonb ('{}'::text), -- JSONB Payload
	'event', -- Event name
	'topic', -- Topic
	FALSE -- Public / Private flag
);
```

### Broadcast record changes

#### Setup realtime authorization

Realtime Authorization is required and enabled by default. To allow your users to listen to messages from topics, create a RLS (Row Level Security) policy:

```sql
CREATE POLICY "authenticated can receive broadcasts"
ON "realtime"."messages"
FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING ( true );

```

See the [Realtime Authorization](/docs/guides/realtime/authorization) docs to learn how to set up more specific policies.

#### Set up trigger function

First, set up a trigger function that uses `realtime.broadcast_changes` to insert an event whenever it is triggered. The event is set up to include data on the schema, table, operation, and field changes that triggered it.

For this example use case, we want to have a topic with the name `topic:<record id>` to which we're going to broadcast events.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.your_table_changes() RETURNS trigger AS $$
BEGIN
    PERFORM realtime.broadcast_changes(
	    'topic:' || NEW.id::text,   -- topic
		   TG_OP,                          -- event
		   TG_OP,                          -- operation
		   TG_TABLE_NAME,                  -- table
		   TG_TABLE_SCHEMA,                -- schema
		   NEW,                            -- new record
		   OLD                             -- old record
		);
    RETURN NULL;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

Of note are the Postgres native trigger special variables used:

- `TG_OP` - the operation that triggered the function
- `TG_TABLE_NAME` - the table that caused the trigger
- `TG_TABLE_SCHEMA` - the schema of the table that caused the trigger invocation
- `NEW` - the record after the change
- `OLD` - the record before the change

You can read more about them in this [guide](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/plpgsql-trigger.html#PLPGSQL-DML-TRIGGER).

#### Set up trigger

Next, set up a trigger so the function runs whenever your target table has a change.

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER broadcast_changes_for_your_table_trigger
AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON public.your_table
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION your_table_changes ();
```

As you can see, it will be broadcasting all operations so our users will receive events when records are inserted, updated or deleted from `public.your_table` .

#### Listen on client side

Finally, client side will requires to be set up to listen to the topic `topic:<record id>` to receive the events.

```jsx
const gameId = 'id'
await supabase.realtime.setAuth() // Needed for Realtime Authorization
const changes = supabase
  .channel(`topic:${gameId}`)
  .on('broadcast', { event: 'INSERT' }, (payload) => console.log(payload))
  .on('broadcast', { event: 'UPDATE' }, (payload) => console.log(payload))
  .on('broadcast', { event: 'DELETE' }, (payload) => console.log(payload))
  .subscribe()
```
