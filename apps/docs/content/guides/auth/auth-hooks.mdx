## Overview

Supabase allows you to use HTTP or Postgres Functions to alter the default Supabase Auth flow. Developers can use hooks to add custom behavior that's not supported natively.

Hooks help you:

- Track the origin of user signups by adding metadata
- Improve security by adding additional checks to password and multi-factor authentication
- Support legacy systems by integrating with identity credentials from external authentication systems
- Add additional custom claims to your JWT

You can use hooks at specific points along an Auth flow to perform custom behavior via a function. The following hooks are available:

| Hook                          | Available on Plan    |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Custom Access Token           | Free, Pro            |
| Send SMS                      | Free, Pro            |
| Send Email                    | Free, Pro            |
| MFA Verification Attempt      | Teams and Enterprise |
| Password Verification Attempt | Teams and Enterprise |

### What is a hook

A Hook is a primitive invoked by Supabase Auth, with an event object, at a point in the flow. The Hook returns an object which provides instructions on how Supabase Auth should continue processing. While the Hook interface is protocol agnostic, platform support is limited to Postgres (SQL) and HTTP Hooks. Pick the Hook corresponding to the medium (PL/pgSQL or JavaScript) that you are most familiar with.

A Postgres Hook is a Postgres Function which takes a single argument -- the event of type JSONB -- and returns a JSONB object. A Postgres Hook runs on Supabase Auth and does not leave the instance. You can read more about Postgres Functions in [the Postgres guide](/docs/guides/database/functions)

</TabPanel>
<TabPanel id="http" label="HTTP">
A HTTP Hook is an endpoint which takes in a JSON event payload and returns a JSON response. HTTP Hooks in Supabase follow the Standard Webhooks Specification, which is a set of guidelines aligning how hooks are implemented. The specification attaches three security headers to guarantee authenticity of the payload:

- `webhook-id`: the unique webhook identifier described in the preceding sections.
- `webhook-timestamp`: integer UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch).
- `webhook-signature`: the signatures of this webhook. This is generated from body of the hook.

You can use any HTTP endpoint as a Hook, including an endpoint on your application. For convenience, a Supabase Edge Function is used for demonstration.

### Hook Security Model

Sign the payload and grant permissions selectively in order to guard the integrity of the payload.

<Tabs

  size="small"
  type="underlined"

  queryGroup="language"
>
<TabPanel id="sql" label="SQL">

You will need to assign additional permissions so that Supabase Auth can access the hook as well as the tables it interacts with.

The `supabase_auth_admin` role does not have permissions to the `public` schema. You need to grant the role permission to execute your hook function:

```sql
grant execute
  on function public.custom_access_token_hook
  to supabase_auth_admin;
```

You also need to grant usage to `supabase_auth_admin`:

```sql
grant usage on schema public to supabase_auth_admin;
```

Also revoke permissions from the `authenticated`, `public`, and `anon` roles to ensure the function is not accessible by Supabase Serverless APIs. The `public` role has access to functions created on `public.*` by default and `anon` and `authenticated` inherit permissions from the `public` role. Permission is revoked from the `public` role in order to prevent the `anon` and `authenticated` roles from inheriting permissions to invoke the Postgres Hook.

```sql
revoke execute
  on function public.custom_access_token_hook
  from authenticated, anon, public;
```

For security, we recommend against the use of the `security definer` tag. The `security definer` tag specifies that the function is to be executed with the privileges of the user that owns it. When a function is created via the Supabase dashboard with the tag, it will have the extensive permissions of the `postgres` role which make it easier for undesirable actions to occur.

We recommend that you do not use any tag and explicitly grant permissions to `supabase_auth_admin` as described above.

Read more about the `security definer` tag [in our database guide](/docs/guides/database/functions#security-definer-vs-invoker).

</TabPanel>
<TabPanel id="http" label="HTTP">

When a HTTP hook is created, the secret generated should be of the following format: `v1,whsec_<standard-base64-secret>`:

- `v1` denotes the version of the hook
- `whsec_` signifies that the secret is symmetric
- `<standard-base64-secret>` implies a Standard Base64 encoded secret which can contain the characters `+`, `/` and `=`

The secret is used to verify the payload received in your hook. Create an entry in your `.env.local` file to store the secret for each hook that you have. For example:

```bash
HOOK_SECRET=<standard-base64-secret>
```

Use the secret in conjunction with the Standard Webhooks package to verify the payload before processing it:

```jsx
import { Webhook } from 'https://esm.sh/standardwebhooks@1.0.0'

Deno.serve(async (req) => {
  const payload = await req.text()
  const hookSecret = Deno.env.get('HOOK_SECRET')
  // Extract headers and security specific fields
  const headers = Object.fromEntries(req.headers)
  const wh = new Webhook(hookSecret)
  const data = wh.verify(payload, headers)

  // Payload data is verified, continue with business logic here
  // ...
})
```

</TabPanel>

## Using Hooks

### Developing

Let us develop a Hook locally and then deploy it to the cloud. As a recap, here’s a list of available Hooks

| Hook                          | Suggested Function Name         | When it is called                                  | What it Does                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Send SMS                      | `send_sms`                      | Each time an SMS is sent                           | Allows you to customize message content and SMS Provider                                                  |
| Send Email                    | `send_email`                    | Each time an Email is sent                         | Allows you to customize message content and Email Provider                                                |
| Custom Access Token           | `custom_access_token`           | Each time a new JWT is created                     | Returns the claims you wish to be present in the JWT.                                                     |
| MFA Verification Attempt      | `mfa_verification_attempt`      | Each time a user tries to verify an MFA factor.    | Returns a decision on whether to reject the attempt and future ones, or to allow the user to keep trying. |
| Password Verification Attempt | `password_verification_attempt` | Each time a user tries to sign in with a password. | Return a decision whether to allow the user to reject the attempt, or to allow the user to keep trying.   |

Edit config.toml to set up the Auth Hook locally.

<Tabs
  scrollable
  size="small"
  type="underlined"

  queryGroup="language"
>
<TabPanel id="sql" label="SQL">
Modify the `auth.hook.<hook_name>` field and set `uri` to a value of `pg-functions://postgres/<schema>/<function_name>`

```
[auth.hook.<hook_name>]
enabled = true
uri = "pg-functions://...."

```

You need to assign additional permissions so that Supabase Auth can access the hook as well as the tables it interacts with.

The `supabase_auth_admin` role does not have permissions to the `public` schema. You need to grant the role permission to execute your hook:

```sql
grant execute
  on function public.custom_access_token_hook
  to supabase_auth_admin;

```

You also need to grant usage to `supabase_auth_admin`:

```sql
grant usage on schema public to supabase_auth_admin;

```

Also revoke permissions from the `authenticated` and `anon` roles to ensure the function is not accessible by Supabase Serverless APIs.

```sql
revoke execute
  on function public.custom_access_token_hook
  from authenticated, anon;

```

For security, we recommend against the use the `security definer` tag. The `security definer` tag specifies that the function is to be executed with the privileges of the user that owns it. When a function is created via the Supabase dashboard with the tag, it will have the extensive permissions of the `postgres` role which make it easier for undesirable actions to occur.

We recommend that you do not use any tag and explicitly grant permissions to `supabase_auth_admin` as described above.

Read more about `security definer` tag [in our database guide](/docs/guides/database/functions#security-definer-vs-invoker).

There are no restrictions as to what language can be used to write a Postgres Hook. If [PL/pgSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/plpgsql.html) is too difficult consider using the [plv8](/docs/guides/database/extensions/plv8) extension which lets you use JavaScript to define functions.

Once done, save your Auth Hook as a migration in order to version the Auth Hook and share it with other team members. Run [`supabase migration new`](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-migration-new) to create a migration.

<Admonition type="caution">

If you're using the Supabase SQL Editor, there's an issue when using the `?` (_Does the string exist as a top-level key within the JSON value?_) operator. Use a direct connection to the database if you need to use it when defining a function.

</Admonition>

Here is an example hook signature:

```sql
create or replace function public.custom_access_token_hook(event jsonb)
returns jsonb
language plpgsql
as $$
declare
  -- Insert variables here
begin
  -- Insert logic here
  return event;
end;
$$;

```

You can visit `SQL Editor > Templates` for hook templates.

</TabPanel>
<TabPanel id="http" label="HTTP">
Modify the `auth.hook.<hook_name>` field and set `uri` to a valid HTTP URI. For example, the `send_sms` hook would take the following fields:
```
[auth.hook.send_sms]
enabled = true
uri = "http://host.docker.internal:54321/functions/v1/sms_sender"
secret = "env(SEND_SMS_HOOK_SECRET)"
```

`host.docker.internal` is a special DNS name used in Docker to allow a container to access the host machine's network. This allows the Auth container to reach the Functions container

Fill in the Hook Secret in `supabase/functions/.env`

```jsx
SEND_SMS_HOOK_SECRET = '<base64_standard_secret>'
```

Start the function locally:

```bash
supabase functions serve send-sms --no-verify-jwt
```

Disable JWT verification via the `--no-verify-jwt` to accommodate hooks which are run before a JWT is issued. Payload authenticity is instead protected via the appended security headers associated with the Standard Webhooks Standard.

Note that payloads are sent uncompressed (Encoding: `identity`) in order to accurately track Content Length. In addition, there is a 20KB payload limit to guard against payload stuffing attacks.

### Deploying

In the dashboard, navigate to [`Authentication > Hooks`](/dashboard/project/_/auth/hooks) and select the appropriate function type (SQL or HTTP) from the dropdown menu.

### Error Handling

You should return an error when facing a runtime error. Runtime errors are specific to your application and arise from specific business rules rather than programmer errors.

Runtime errors could happen when:

- The user does not have appropriate permissions
- The event payload received does not have required claims.
- The user has performed an action which violates a business rule.
- The email or phone provider used in the webhook returned an error.

<Tabs
  scrollable
  size="small"
  type="underlined"
  defaultActiveId="sql"
  queryGroup="language"
>
<TabPanel id="sql" label="SQL">

The error is a JSON object and has the following properties:

- `error` An object that contains information about the error.
  - `http_code` A number indicating the HTTP code to be returned. If not set, the code is HTTP 500 Internal Server Error.
  - `message` A message to be returned in the HTTP response. Required.

Here's an example:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "http_code": 429,
    "message": "You can only verify a factor once every 10 seconds."
  }
}
```

Errors returned from a Postgres Hook are not retry-able. When an error is returned, the error is propagated from the hook to Supabase Auth and translated into a HTTP error which is returned to your application. Supabase Auth will only take into account the error and disregard the rest of the payload.

</TabPanel>

<TabPanel id="http" label="HTTP">
Hooks return status codes based on the nature of the response. These status codes help determine the next steps in the processing flow:

| HTTP Status Code | Description                                                   | Example Usage                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 200, 202, 204    | Valid response, proceed                                       | Successful processing of the request           |
| 429, 503         | Retry-able errors with Retry-after header supported           | Temporary server overload or maintenance       |
| 403, 400         | Treated as Internal Server Errors and return a 500 Error Code | Malformed requests or insufficient permissions |

Errors are responses which contain status codes 400 and above. On a retry-able error, such as an error with a `429` or `503` status code, HTTP Hooks will attempt up to three retries with a back-off of two seconds.

Here’s a sample HTTP retry schedule:

| Time Since Start (HH:MM:SS) | Event                   | Notes                                             |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 00:00:00                    | Initial Attempt         | Initial invocation begins.                        |
| 00:00:05                    | Initial Attempt Timeout | Initial invocation must complete.                 |
| 00:00:07                    | Retry Start #1          | After 2 sec delay, first retry begins.            |
| 00:00:12                    | Retry Timeout #1        | First retry timeout.                              |
| 00:00:14                    | Retry Start #2          | After 2 sec delay, second retry begins.           |
| 00:00:19                    | Retry Timeout #2        | Second retry timeout. Returns an error on failure |

Return a retry-able error by attaching a appropriate status code (`429`, `503` ) and a non-empty `retry-after` header

```jsx
return new Response(
  JSON.stringify({
    error: `Failed to process the request: ${error}`,
  }),
  { status: 429, headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json', 'retry-after': 'true' } }
)
```

Note that all responses, including error responses, need a `Content-Type` of `application/json` - not specifying the appropriate `Content-Type` will result in the function returning an error response. Supabase Auth will in turn return an Internal Server Error.

</TabPanel>
</Tabs>

Outside of runtime errors, both HTTP Hooks and Postgres Hooks return timeout errors. Postgres Hooks have <SharedData data="config">auth.hook_timeouts.postgres_hooks</SharedData> seconds to complete processing while HTTP Hooks should complete in <SharedData data="config">auth.hook_timeouts.http_hooks</SharedData> seconds. Both HTTP Hooks and Postgres Hooks are run in a transaction do limit the duration of execution to avoid delays in authentication process.

## Available Hooks

Each Hook description contains an example JSONSchema which you can use in conjunction with [JSONSchema Faker](https://json-schema-faker.js.org/) in order to generate a mock payload. For HTTP Hooks, you can also use [the Standard Webhooks Testing Tool](https://www.standardwebhooks.com/simulate) to simulate a request.

### MFA verification attempt

You can add additional checks to the [Supabase MFA implementation](/docs/guides/auth/auth-mfa) with hooks. For example, you can:

- Limit the number of verification attempts performed over a period of time.
- Sign out users who have too many invalid verification attempts.
- Count, rate limit, or ban sign-ins.

**Inputs**

Supabase Auth will supply the following fields to your hook:

- `factor_id` Unique identifier for the MFA factor being verified.
- `user_id` Unique identifier for the user.
- `valid` Whether the verification attempt was valid. For TOTP, this means that the six digit code was correct (true) or incorrect (false).

Example payload:

**Outputs**

Return this if your hook processed the input without errors.

- `decision` A string containing the decision on whether to allow authentication to move forward. Use `reject` to deny the verification attempt and log the user out of all active sessions. Use `continue` to use the default Supabase Auth behavior.
- `message` The message to show the user if the decision was `reject`.

Example output:

```json
{
  "decision": "reject",
  "message": "You have exceeded maximum number of MFA attempts."

Your company requires that a user can input an incorrect MFA Verification code no more than once every 2 seconds.

Create a table to record the last time a user had an incorrect MFA verification attempt for a factor.

```sql
create table public.mfa_failed_verification_attempts (
  user_id uuid not null,
  factor_id uuid not null,
  last_failed_at timestamp not null default now(),

### Password verification attempt

Your company wishes to increase security beyond the requirements of the default password implementation in order to fulfill security or compliance requirements. You plan to track the status of a password sign-in attempt and take action via an email or a restriction on logins where necessary.

As this hook runs on unauthenticated requests, malicious users can abuse the hook by calling it multiple times. Pay extra care when using the hook as you can unintentionally block legitimate users from accessing your application.

Check if a password is valid prior to taking any additional action to ensure the user is legitimate. Where possible, send an email or notification instead of blocking the user.

**Inputs**

- `user_id` Unique identifier for the user attempting to sign in. Correlate this to the `auth.users` table.
- `valid` Whether the password verification attempt was valid.

  ]
}
```
</TabPanel>
</Tabs>

**Outputs**

Return these only if your hook processed the input without errors.

- `decision` A string containing the decision whether to allow authentication to move forward. Use `reject` to completely reject the verification attempt and log the user out of all active sessions. Use `continue` to use the default Supabase Auth behavior.
- `message` The message to show the user if the decision was `reject`.
- `should_logout_user` Whether to logout a user if a `reject` decision is issued. Has no effect when a `continue` decision is issued.

Example output:

```json
{
  "decision": "reject",
  "message": "You have exceeded maximum number of password sign-in attempts.",
  "should_logout_user": "false"
}
```

As part of new security measures within the company, users can only input an incorrect password every 10 seconds and not more than that. You want to write a hook to enforce this.

Create a table to record each user's last incorrect password verification attempt.

```sql
create table public.password_failed_verification_attempts (
  user_id uuid not null,
  last_failed_at timestamp not null default now(),
  primary key (user_id)
);
```

Create a hook to read and write information to this table. For example:

```sql
create function public.hook_password_verification_attempt(event jsonb)
returns jsonb
language plpgsql
as $$
  declare
    last_failed_at timestamp;
  begin
    if event->'valid' is true then
      -- password is valid, accept it
      return jsonb_build_object('decision', 'continue');
    end if;

    select last_failed_at into last_failed_at
      from public.password_failed_verification_attempts
      where
        user_id = event->'user_id';

    end if;

    -- record this failed attempt
    insert into public.password_failed_verification_attempts
      (
        user_id,

<TabPanel id="sql-send-email-on-failed-password-attempt" label="Send email notification on failed password attempts">

You can notify a user via email instead of blocking the user. To do so, make use of [Supabase Vault](/docs/guides/database/vault) to store the API Key of our mail provider and use [`pg_net`](/docs/guides/database/extensions/pg_net) to send a HTTP request to our email provider to send the email. Ensure that you have configured a sender signature for the email account which you are sending emails from.

First, create a table to track sign in attempts.

```sql
create table public.password_sign_in_attempts (
  user_id uuid not null,
  attempt_id uuid not null,
  last_attempt_at timestamp not null default now(),
  attempt_successful boolean not null,
  primary key (user_id, attempt_id)
);
```

Next, store the API key of our email API provider:

```sql
select vault.create_secret('my_api_key', 'my_api_key_name', 'description_of_my_api_key');
```

Create the hook:

```sql
create or replace function public.hook_notify_user_on_failed_attempts(event jsonb)
returns jsonb
language plpgsql
as $$
  declare
    user_id uuid;
    server_token text;
    user_email_address text;
    email_body jsonb;

    http_code int;
    error_message jsonb;
    attempt_count int;
    max_attempts int := 5; -- Set the threshold for failed attempts
  begin
    user_id := (event->>'user_id')::uuid;

    -- Record the attempt
    insert into public.password_sign_in_attempts (user_id, attempt_id, last_attempt_at, attempt_successful)
    values (user_id, (event->>'attempt_id')::uuid, now(), (event->>'valid')::boolean)
    on conflict (user_id, attempt_id)
    do update set last_attempt_at = now(), attempt_successful = (event->>'valid')::boolean;

    -- Check failed attempts and fetch user email
    select count(*), u.email into attempt_count, user_email_address
    from public.password_sign_in_attempts a
    join auth.users u on a.user_id = u.id
    where a.user_id = user_id and attempt_successful = false and last_attempt_at > (now() - interval '1 day');

    -- Notify user if the number of failed attempts exceeds the threshold
    if attempt_count >= max_attempts then
      -- Fetch the server token
      select decrypted_secret into server_token from vault.decrypted_secrets where name = 'my_api_key_name';

### Custom access token

The custom access token hook runs before a token is issued and allows you to add additional claims based on the authentication method used.

Claims returned must conform to our specification. Supabase Auth will check for these claims after the hook is run and return an error if they are not present.

These are the fields currently available on an access token:

Required Claims: `aud`, `exp`, `iat`, `sub`, `email`, `phone`, `role`, `aal`, `session_id`
Optional Claims: `jti`, `iss`, `nbf`, `app_metadata`, `user_metadata`, `amr`

**Inputs**

- `user_id` Unique identifier for the user attempting to sign in. Correlate this to the `auth.users` table.
- `claims` Claims which are attached to the access token.
- `authentication_method` the authentication method used to request the access token. Possible values include:
  `oauth`, `password`, `otp`, `totp`, `recovery`, `invite`, `sso/saml`, `magiclink`, `email/signup`, `email_change`, `token_refresh`, `anonymous`.

### Send SMS

Runs before a message is sent. Use the hook to:
- Use a regional SMS Provider
- Use alternate messaging channels such as WhatsApp
- Adjust the message body to include platform specific fields such as the [AppHash](https://developers.google.com/identity/sms-retriever/overview)

**Inputs**

- `user` User attempting to sign in. Correlate this to the `auth.users` table.
- `sms` Metadata specific to the SMS sending process. Includes the OTP.

<TabPanel id="sql-send-message-via-job-queue" label="Queue SMS Messages">

Your company uses a worker to manage all messaging related jobs. For performance reasons, the messaging system sends messages in intervals via a job queue. Instead of sending a message immediately, messages are queued and sent in periodic intervals via `pg_cron`.

Create a table to store jobs

```sql
create table job_queue (
  job_id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  job_data jsonb not null,
  created_at timestamp default now(),
  status text default 'pending',
  priority int default 0,
  retry_count int default 0,
  max_retries int default 2,
  scheduled_at timestamp default now()
);
```

Create the hook:

```sql
create or replace function send_sms(event jsonb) returns void as $$
declare
    job_data jsonb;
    scheduled_time timestamp;
    priority int;
begin
    -- extract phone and otp from the event json
    job_data := jsonb_build_object(
        'phone', event->'user'->>'phone',
        'otp', event->'sms'->>'otp'
    );

    -- calculate the nearest 5-minute window for scheduled_time
    scheduled_time := date_trunc('minute', now()) + interval '5 minute' * floor(extract('epoch' from (now() - date_trunc('minute', now())) / 60) / 5);

    -- assign priority dynamically (example logic: higher priority for earlier scheduled time)
    priority := extract('epoch' from (scheduled_time - now()))::int;

    -- insert the job into the job_queue table
    insert into job_queue (job_data, priority, scheduled_at, max_retries)
    values (job_data, priority, scheduled_time, 2);
end;
$$ language plpgsql;

grant execute
  on function public.send_sms
  to supabase_auth_admin;

revoke execute
  on function public.send_sms
  from authenticated, anon;

grant all
  on table public.job_queue
  to supabase_auth_admin;

revoke all
  on table public.job_queue
  from authenticated, anon;
```

Create a function to periodically run and dequeue all jobs

```sql
create or replace function dequeue_and_run_jobs() returns void as $$
declare
    job record;
begin
    for job in
        select * from job_queue
        where status = 'pending'
          and scheduled_at <= now()
        order by priority desc, created_at
        for update skip locked
    loop
        begin
            -- add job processing logic here.
            -- for demonstration, we'll just update the job status to 'completed'.
            update job_queue
            set status = 'completed'
            where job_id = job.job_id;

        exception when others then
            -- handle job failure and retry logic
            if job.retry_count < job.max_retries then
                update job_queue
                set retry_count = retry_count + 1,
                    scheduled_at = now() + interval '1 minute'  -- delay retry by 1 minute
                where job_id = job.job_id;
            else
                update job_queue
                set status = 'failed'
                where job_id = job.job_id;
            end if;
        end;
    end loop;
end;
$$ language plpgsql;

grant execute
  on function public.dequeue_and_run_jobs
  to supabase_auth_admin;

revoke execute
  on function public.dequeue_and_run_jobs
  from authenticated, anon;
```

Configure `pg_cron` to run the job on an interval. You can use a tool like [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru/) to check that your job is running on an appropriate schedule. Ensure that `pg_cron` is enabled under `Database > Extensions`

```sql
select
  cron.schedule(
    '* * * * *', -- this cron expression means every minute.
    'select dequeue_and_run_jobs();'
  );
```

### Send Email

The Send Email Hook runs before an email is sent and allows for flexibility around email sending. You can use this hook to configure a back-up email provider or add internationalization to your emails.

**Inputs**

- `user` User attempting to sign in. Correlate this to the `auth.users` table.
- `email` Metadata specific to the email sending process. Includes the OTP and `token_hash`.

Your company uses a worker to manage all emails related jobs. For performance reasons, the messaging system sends emails in batches via a job queue. Instead of sending a message immediately, messages are queued and sent in periodic intervals via `pg_cron`.

Create a table to store jobs

```sql
create table job_queue (
  job_id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  job_data jsonb not null,
  created_at timestamp default now(),
  status text default 'pending',
  priority int default 0,
  retry_count int default 0,
  max_retries int default 2,
  scheduled_at timestamp default now()
);
```

Create the hook

```sql
create or replace function send_email(event jsonb) returns void as $$
declare
    job_data jsonb;
    scheduled_time timestamp;
    priority int;
begin
    -- Extract email details from the event JSON
    job_data := jsonb_build_object(
        'email_action_type', event->'email_data'->>'email_action_type',
        'token_hash', event->'email_data'->>'token_hash',
        'token', event->'email_data'->>'token',
        'email', event->'user'->>'email'
    );

    -- Calculate the nearest 5-minute window for scheduled_time
    scheduled_time := date_trunc('minute', now()) + interval '5 minute' * floor(extract('epoch' from (now() - date_trunc('minute', now())) / 60) / 5);

    -- Assign priority dynamically (example logic: higher priority for earlier scheduled time)
    priority := extract('epoch' from (scheduled_time - now()))::int;

    insert into job_queue (job_data, priority, scheduled_at, max_retries)
    values (job_data, priority, scheduled_time, 2);
end;
$$ language plpgsql;

grant execute
  on function public.send_email
  to supabase_auth_admin;

revoke execute
  on function public.send_email
  from authenticated, anon;

grant all
  on table public.job_queue
  to supabase_auth_admin;

revoke all
  on table public.job_queue
  from authenticated, anon;
```

Create a function to periodically run and dequeue all jobs

```sql
create or replace function dequeue_and_run_jobs() returns void as $$
declare
    job record;
begin
    for job in
        select * from job_queue
        where status = 'pending'
          and scheduled_at <= now()
        order by priority desc, created_at
        for update skip locked
    loop
        begin
            -- add job processing logic here.
            -- for demonstration, we'll just update the job status to 'completed'.
            update job_queue
            set status = 'completed'
            where job_id = job.job_id;

        exception when others then
            -- handle job failure and retry logic
            if job.retry_count < job.max_retries then
                update job_queue
                set retry_count = retry_count + 1,
                    scheduled_at = now() + interval '1 minute'  -- delay retry by 1 minute
                where job_id = job.job_id;
            else
                update job_queue
                set status = 'failed'
                where job_id = job.job_id;
            end if;
        end;
    end loop;
end;
$$ language plpgsql;

grant execute
  on function public.dequeue_and_run_jobs
  to supabase_auth_admin;

revoke execute
  on function public.dequeue_and_run_jobs
  from authenticated, anon;
```

Configure `pg_cron` to run the job on an interval. You can use a tool like [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru/) to check that your job is running on an appropriate schedule. Ensure that `pg_cron` is enabled under `Database > Extensions`

```sql
select
  cron.schedule(
    '* * * * *', -- this cron expression means every minute.
    'select dequeue_and_run_jobs();'
  );
```

Your company is rapidly growing and depends heavily on email signups. You'd like to configure a backup email provider in case the email provider runs out of credits during your new product launch. Postmark and Sengrid are used as examples but in practice you can use any email provider.
Ensure that you have configured `POSTMARK_SERVER_TOKEN`, `SENDGRID_API_KEY` and `AUTH_SEND_EMAIL_HOOK_SECRET` in your `.env` file.
