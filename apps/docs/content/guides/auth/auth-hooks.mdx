description: 'Use Supabase Postgres Functions to customize your authentication flow'
---

Supabase allows you to use Postgres functions to alter the default Supabase Auth flow. Developers can use hooks to add custom behavior that's not supported natively.

Hooks help you:

- Track the origin of user signups by adding metadata
- Improve security by adding additional checks to password and multi-factor authentication
- Support legacy systems by integrating with identity credentials from external authentication systems
- Add additional custom claims to your JWT

You can use hooks at specific points along an Auth flow to perform custom behavior via Postgres Functions. The following hooks are available:

| Hook                          | Available on Plan    |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Custom Access Token           | Free, Pro            |
| MFA Verification Attempt      | Teams and Enterprise |
| Password Verification Attempt | Teams and Enterprise |

You can connect a hook to Supabase Auth to signal to Supabase Auth that it should make use of the hook.

## Create a hook

### What is a hook

A hook is a [Postgres Function](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createfunction.html) with a single argument -- the `event` of type [JSONB]() -- and which returns a JSONB object.

This function is invoked by Supabase Auth at its point in the flow by providing an event object. The object returned by the function gives instructions on how Supabase Auth should continue processing.

To access properties of the `event` argument, you can use the [JSON operators and functions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html).

There are no restrictions as to what language can be used to write Auth Hooks. If [PL/pgSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/plpgsql.html) is too difficult consider using the [plv8](/docs/guides/database/extensions/plv8) extension which lets you use JavaScript to define functions.

<Admonition type="caution">
  If you're using the Supabase SQL Editor, there's an issue when using the `?` (*Does the string
  exist as a top-level key within the JSON value?*) operator. Use a direct connection to the
  database if you need to use it when defining a function.
</Admonition>

Here is an example hook signature:

```sql
create or replace function public.custom_access_token_hook(event jsonb)
returns jsonb
language plpgsql
as $$
declare
  -- Insert variables here
begin
  -- Insert logic here
  return event;
end;
$$;
```

You can visit `SQL Editor > Templates` for hook templates.

### Hook grants and roles

You need to assign additional permissions so that Supabase Auth can access the hook as well as the tables it interacts with.

The `supabase_auth_admin` role does not have permissions to the `public` schema. You need to grant the role permission to execute your hook function:

```sql
grant execute
  on function public.custom_access_token_hook
  to supabase_auth_admin;
```

You also need to grant usage to `supabase_auth_admin`:

```sql
grant usage on schema public to supabase_auth_admin;
```

Also revoke permissions from the `authenticated` and `anon` roles to ensure the function is not accessible by Supabase Serverless APIs.

```sql
revoke execute
  on function public.custom_access_token_hook
  from authenticated, anon;
```

For security, we recommend against the use the `security definer` tag. The `security definer` tag specifies that the function is to be executed with the privileges of the user that owns it. When a function is created via the Supabase dashboard with the tag, it will have the extensive permissions of the `postgres` role which make it easier for undesirable actions to occur.

We recommend that you do not use any tag and explicitly grant permissions to `supabase_auth_admin` as described above.

Read more about `security definer` tag [in our database guide](/docs/guides/database/functions#security-definer-vs-invoker).

### Hook errors

You should return an error when facing a runtime error. Runtime errors are specific to your application and arise from specific business rules rather than programmer errors.

Runtime errors could happen when:

- The user does not have appropriate permissions
- The event payload received does not have required claims.
- The user has performed an action which violates a business rule.

The error is a JSON object and has the following properties:

- `error` An object that contains information about the error.
  - `http_code` A number indicating the HTTP code to be returned. If not set, the code is HTTP 500 Internal Server Error.
  - `message` A message to be returned in the HTTP response. Required.

Here's an example:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "http_code": 429,
    "message": "You can only verify a factor once every 10 seconds."
  }
}
```

When an error is returned, the error is propagated from the hook to Supabase Auth and translated into a HTTP error which is returned to your application. Supabase Auth will only take into account the error and disregard the rest of the payload.

### Timeouts

Ensure that your hooks complete within **2 seconds** to avoid any errors.

### Connect a hook

In the dashboard, navigate to [`Authentication > Hooks (Beta)`](/dashboard/project/_/auth/hooks) and select the appropriate PostgreSQL function from the dropdown menu.

## Hook: MFA verification attempt

You can add additional checks to the [Supabase MFA implementation](/docs/guides/auth/auth-mfa) with hooks. For example, you can:

- Limit the number of verification attempts performed over a period of time.
- Sign out users who have too many invalid verification attempts.
- Count, rate limit, or ban sign-ins.

**Inputs**

Supabase Auth will supply the following fields to your hook:

- `factor_id` Unique identifier for the MFA factor being verified.
- `user_id` Unique identifier for the user.
- `valid` Whether the verification attempt was valid. For TOTP, this means that the six digit code was correct (true) or incorrect (false).

Example payload:

```json
{
  "factor_id": "6eab6a69-7766-48bf-95d8-bd8f606894db",
  "user_id": "3919cb6e-4215-4478-a960-6d3454326cec",
  "valid": true
}
```

**Outputs**

Return this if your hook processed the input without errors.

- `decision` A string containing the decision on whether to allow authentication to move forward. Use `reject` to deny the verification attempt and log the user out of all active sessions. Use `continue` to use the default Supabase Auth behavior.
- `message` The message to show the user if the decision was `reject`.

Example output:

```json
{
  "decision": "reject",
  "message": "You have exceeded maximum number of MFA attempts."
}
```

**Examples**

<Tabs
  scrollable
  size="small"
  type="underlined"
  defaultActiveId="limit-failed-mfa-verification-attempts"
  queryGroup="language"
>
<TabPanel id="limit-failed-mfa-verification-attempts" label="Limit failed MFA verification attempts">

Your company requires that a user can input an incorrect MFA Verification code no more than once every 2 seconds.

Create a table to record the last time a user had an incorrect MFA verification attempt for a factor.

```sql
create table public.mfa_failed_verification_attempts (
  user_id uuid not null,
  factor_id uuid not null,
  last_failed_at timestamp not null default now(),
  primary key (user_id, factor_id)
);
```

Create a hook to read and write information to this table. For example:

```sql
create function public.hook_mfa_verification_attempt(event jsonb)
  returns jsonb
  language plpgsql
as $$
  declare
    last_failed_at timestamp;
  begin
    if event->'valid' is true then
      -- code is valid, accept it
      return jsonb_build_object('decision', 'continue');
    end if;

    select last_failed_at into last_failed_at
      from public.mfa_failed_verification_attempts
      where
        user_id = event->'user_id'
          and
        factor_id = event->'factor_id';

    if last_failed_at is not null and now() - last_failed_at < interval '2 seconds' then
      -- last attempt was done too quickly
      return jsonb_build_object(
        'error', jsonb_build_object(
          'http_code', 429,
          'message',   'Please wait a moment before trying again.'
        )
      );
    end if;

    -- record this failed attempt
    insert into public.mfa_failed_verification_attempts
      (
        user_id,
        factor_id,
        last_refreshed_at
      )
      values
      (
        event->'user_id',
        event->'factor_id',
        now()
      )
      on conflict do update
        set last_refreshed_at = now();

    -- finally let Supabase Auth do the default behavior for a failed attempt
    return jsonb_build_object('decision', 'continue');
  end;
$$;

-- Assign appropriate permissions and revoke access

## Hook: Password verification attempt

Your company wishes to increase security beyond the requirements of the default password implementation in order to fulfill security or compliance requirements. You plan to track the status of a password sign-in attempt and take action via an email or a restriction on logins where necessary.

As this hook runs on unauthenticated requests, malicious users can abuse the hook by calling it multiple times. Pay extra care when using the hook as you can unintentionally block legitimate users from accessing your application.

Check if a password is valid prior to taking any additional action to ensure the user is legitimate. Where possible, send an email or notification instead of blocking the user.

**Inputs**

- `user_id` Unique identifier for the user attempting to sign in. Correlate this to the `auth.users` table.
- `valid` Whether the password verification attempt was valid.

```json
{
  "user_id": "3919cb6e-4215-4478-a960-6d3454326cec",
  "valid": true
}
```

**Outputs**

Return these only if your hook processed the input without errors.

- `decision` A string containing the decision whether to allow authentication to move forward. Use `reject` to completely reject the verification attempt and log the user out of all active sessions. Use `continue` to use the default Supabase Auth behavior.
- `message` The message to show the user if the decision was `reject`.
- `should_logout_user` Whether to logout a user if a `reject` decision is issued. Has no effect when a `continue` decision is issued.

Example output:

```json
{
  "decision": "reject",
  "message": "You have exceeded maximum number of password sign-in attempts.",
  "should_logout_user": "false"
}
```

**Examples**

<Tabs

  defaultActiveId="limit-failed-password-verification-attempts"
  queryGroup="language"
>
<TabPanel id="limit-failed-password-verification-attempts" label="Limit failed password verification attempts">

As part of new security measures within the company, users can only input an incorrect password every 10 seconds and not more than that. You want to write a hook to enforce this.

Create a table to record each user's last incorrect password verification attempt.

```sql
create table public.password_failed_verification_attempts (
  user_id uuid not null,
  last_failed_at timestamp not null default now(),
  primary key (user_id)
);
```

Create a hook to read and write information to this table. For example:

```sql
create function public.hook_password_verification_attempt(event jsonb)
returns jsonb
language plpgsql
as $$
  declare
    last_failed_at timestamp;
  begin
    if event->'valid' is true then
      -- password is valid, accept it
      return jsonb_build_object('decision', 'continue');
    end if;

    select last_failed_at into last_failed_at
      from public.password_failed_verification_attempts
      where
        user_id = event->'user_id';

    if last_failed_at is not null and now() - last_failed_at < interval '10 seconds' then
      -- last attempt was done too quickly
      return jsonb_build_object(
        'error', jsonb_build_object(
          'http_code', 429,
          'message',   'Please wait a moment before trying again.'
        )
      );
    end if;

    -- record this failed attempt
    insert into public.password_failed_verification_attempts
      (
        user_id,
        last_failed_at
      )
      values
      (
        event->'user_id',
        now()
      )
      on conflict do update
        set last_failed_at = now();

    -- finally let Supabase Auth do the default behavior for a failed attempt
    return jsonb_build_object('decision', 'continue');

<TabPanel id="send-email-on-failed-password-attempt" label="Send email notification on failed password attempts">

You can notify a user via email instead of blocking the user. To do so, make use of [Supabase Vault](/docs/guides/database/vault) to store the API Key of our mail provider and use [`pg_net`](/docs/guides/database/extensions/pg_net) to send a HTTP request to our email provider to send the email. Ensure that you have configured a sender signature for the email account which you are sending emails from.

First, create a table to track sign in attempts.

```sql
create table public.password_sign_in_attempts (
  user_id uuid not null,
  attempt_id uuid not null,
  last_attempt_at timestamp not null default now(),
  attempt_successful boolean not null,
  primary key (user_id, attempt_id)
);
```

Next, store the API key of our email API provider:

```sql
select vault.create_secret('my_api_key', 'my_api_key_name', 'description_of_my_api_key');
```

Create the hook:

```sql
create or replace function public.hook_notify_user_on_failed_attempts(event jsonb)

    on conflict (user_id, attempt_id)
    do update set last_attempt_at = now(), attempt_successful = (event->>'valid')::boolean;

    -- Check failed attempts and fetch user email
    select count(*), u.email into attempt_count, user_email_address
    from public.password_sign_in_attempts a

    where a.user_id = user_id and attempt_successful = false and last_attempt_at > (now() - interval '1 day');

    -- Notify user if the number of failed attempts exceeds the threshold

## Hook: Custom access token

The custom access token hook runs before a token is issued and allows you to add additional claims based on the authentication method used.

Claims returned must conform to our specification. Supabase Auth will check for these claims after the hook is run and return an error if they are not present.

These are the fields currently available on an access token:

Required Claims: `aud`, `exp`, `iat`, `sub`, `email`, `phone`, `role`, `aal`, `session_id`
Optional Claims: `jti`, `iss`, `nbf`, `app_metadata`, `user_metadata`, `amr`

**Inputs**

- `user_id` Unique identifier for the user attempting to sign in. Correlate this to the `auth.users` table.
- `claims` Claims which are attached to the access token.
- `authentication_method` the authentication method used to request the access token. Possible values include:
  `oauth`, `password`, `otp`, `totp`, `recovery`, `invite`, `sso/saml`, `magiclink`, `email/signup`, `email_change`, `token_refresh`.

**Outputs**

Return these only if your hook processed the input without errors.

- `claims` A json containing the updated claims after the hook has been run.

**Examples**

<TabPanel id="add-admin-role" label="Add admin role">

You can allow registered admin users to perform restricted actions by granting an `admin` claim to their token.

Create a profiles table with an `is_admin` flag:

```sql
create table profiles (
  user_id uuid not null primary key references auth.users (id),
  is_admin boolean not null default false
);
```

Create a hook:

```sql
create or replace function public.custom_access_token_hook(event jsonb)

as $$
  declare
    claims jsonb;
    is_admin boolean;
  begin
    -- Check if the user is marked as admin in the profiles table
    select is_admin into is_admin from profiles where user_id = (event->>'user_id')::uuid;

    -- Proceed only if the user is an admin
    if is_admin then
      claims := event->'claims';

      -- Check if 'app_metadata' exists in claims
      if jsonb_typeof(claims->'app_metadata') is null then
        -- If 'app_metadata' does not exist, create an empty object
        claims := jsonb_set(claims, '{app_metadata}', '{}');
      end if;

      -- Set a claim of 'admin'
      claims := jsonb_set(claims, '{app_metadata, admin}', 'true');

      -- Update the 'claims' object in the original event
      event := jsonb_set(event, '{claims}', claims);

## Local Development

Unlike the hosted platform, the local development dashboard does not have a user interface for linking a Hook. Instead, edit `config.toml` to link an Auth Hook and run it with your local setup. Modify the `auth.hook.<hook_name>` field and set `uri` to a value of `pg-functions://postgres/<schema>/<function_name>`

For instance, the `config.toml` for a Custom Access Token Hook which uses the function `public.custom_access_token_hook`:

```
...

[auth.hook.custom_access_token]
enabled = true
uri = "pg-functions://postgres/public/custom_access_token_hook"

...
```

Save your Auth Hook as a migration in order to version the Auth Hook and share it with other team members. Run [`supabase migration new`](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/cli/supabase-migration-new) to create a migration.

### Debugging Your Hook

Test the Postgres Function in isolation before enabling the hook by connecting to your database with `psql` and running `select <your_function_name>`. Where necessary, use [`RAISE` statements](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/plpgsql-errors-and-messages.html) to print information to the terminal.
