Supabase Auth supports Sign in with Google for the web, native Android applications, and Chrome extensions.

## Prerequisites

- A Google Cloud project. Go to the [Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard) and create a new project if necessary.

## Configuration

To support Sign In with Google, you need to configure the Google provider for your Supabase project.

<Tabs
  scrollable
  size="large"
  type="underlined"
  defaultActiveId="web"
  queryGroup="platform"
>
  <TabPanel id="web" label="Web">

For web applications, you can set up your signin button two different ways:

- Use your own [application code](#application-code) for the button.
- Use [Google's pre-built sign-in or OneTap flows](#google-pre-built).

### Application code configuration

To use your own application code:

1. In the Google Cloud console, go to the [Consent Screen configuration page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent). The consent screen is the view shown to your users when they consent to signing in to your app.
1. Under **Authorized domains**, add your Supabase project's domain, which has the form `<PROJECT_ID>.supabase.co`.
1. Configure the following non-sensitive scopes:
   - `.../auth/userinfo.email`
   - `...auth/userinfo.profile`
   - `openid`
1. Go to the [API Credentials page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).
1. Click `Create credentials` and choose `OAuth Client ID`.
1. For application type, choose `Web application`.
1. Under **Authorized JavaScript origins**, add your site URL.
1. Under **Authorized redirect URLs**, enter the callback URL from the [Supabase dashboard](/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers). Expand the Google Auth Provider section to display it.

   <Admonition type="tip">

   The redirect URL is visible to your users. You can customize it by configuring [custom domains](/docs/guides/platform/custom-domains).

   </Admonition>

1. When you finish configuring your credentials, you will be shown your client ID and secret. Add these to the [Google Auth Provider section of the Supabase Dashboard](/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers).

   <Admonition type="tip">

   In local development, you can add the client ID and secret to your `config.toml` file.

   </Admonition>

### Google pre-built configuration

To use Google's pre-built signin buttons:

1. In the Google Cloud console, go to the [Consent Screen configuration page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent). The consent screen is the view shown to your users when they consent to signing in to your app.
1. Configure the screen to your liking, making sure you add links to your app's privacy policy and terms of service.
1. Go to the [API Credentials page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).
1. Click `Create credentials` and choose `OAuth Client ID`.
1. For application type, choose `Web application`.
1. Under **Authorized JavaScript origins** and **Authorized redirect URLs**, add your site URL. This is the URL of the website where the signin button will appear, _not_ your Supabase project domain.
1. When you finish configuring your credentials, you will be shown your client ID. Add this to the **Authorized Client IDs** field in the [Google Auth Provider section of the Supabase Dashboard](/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers). Leave the OAuth client ID and secret blank. You don't need them when using Google's pre-built approach.

  <TabPanel id="react-native" label="Expo React Native">

    1. Configure OAuth credentials for your Google Cloud project in the [Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) page of the console. When creating a new OAuth client ID, choose _Android_ or _iOS_ depending on the mobile operating system your app is built for.
        - For Android, use the instructions on screen to provide the SHA-1 certificate fingerprint used to sign your Android app.
          - You will have a different set of SHA-1 certificate fingerprint for testing locally and going to production. Make sure to add both to the Google Cloud Console. and add all of the Client IDs to Supabase dashboard.
        - For iOS, use the instructions on screen to provide the app Bundle ID, and App Store ID and Team ID if the app is already published on the Apple AppStore.
    2. Configure the [OAuth Consent Screen](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent). This information is shown to the user when giving consent to your app. In particular, make sure you have set up links to your app's privacy policy and terms of service.
    3. Finally, add the client ID from step 1 in the [Google provider on the Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers), under _Authorized Client IDs_.

    Note that you do not have to configure the OAuth flow in the Supabase Dashboard in order to use native sign in.

  <TabPanel id="flutter" label="Flutter">

    ### iOS and Android

    1. Configure Web, Android, and iOS OAuth credentials. Follow the Platform integration instructions on the [README of google_sign_in package](https://pub.dev/packages/google_sign_in#platform-integration) for Android and iOS.
        - For both Android and iOS, you will need to create a Web client ID in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).
        - For Android, use the instructions on screen to provide the SHA-1 certificate fingerprint used to sign your Android app.
          - You will have a different set of SHA-1 certificate fingerprint for testing locally and going to production. Make sure to add both to the Google Cloud Console. and add all of the Client IDs to Supabase dashboard.
        - For iOS, use the instructions on screen to provide the app Bundle ID, and App Store ID and Team ID if the app is already published on the Apple AppStore.
    2. Configure the [OAuth Consent Screen](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent). This information is shown to the user when giving consent to your app. In particular, make sure you have set up links to your app's privacy policy and terms of service.
    3. Add only the web client ID from step 1 in the [Google provider on the Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers), under _Authorized Client IDs_. If you need iOS support, enable the `Skip nonce check` option.
    4. For iOS, add the `CFBundleURLTypes` attributes below into the `/ios/Runner/Info.plist` file.
        ```xml
        <!-- Put me in the [my_project]/ios/Runner/Info.plist file -->
        <!-- Google Sign-in Section -->
        <key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
        <array>
          <dict>
            <key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>
            <string>Editor</string>
            <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
            <array>
              <!-- TODO Replace this value: -->
              <!-- Copied from GoogleService-Info.plist key REVERSED_CLIENT_ID -->
              <string>com.googleusercontent.apps.861823949799-vc35cprkp249096uujjn0vvnmcvjppkn</string>
            </array>
          </dict>
        </array>
        <!-- End of the Google Sign-in Section -->
        ```

    ### Web, macOS, Windows, and Linux

    To use the OAuth 2.0 flow, you will require the following information:

    1. Obtain OAuth credentials for your Google Cloud project in the [Credentials](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials) page of the console. If you already have a web client ID, no need to create a new one. When creating a new credential, choose _Web application_. In _Authorized redirect URIs_ enter `https://<project-id>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`. This URL will be seen by your users, and you can customize it by configuring [custom domains](/docs/guides/platform/custom-domains).
    2. Configure the [OAuth Consent Screen](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent). This information is shown to the user when giving consent to your app. Within _Authorized domains_ make sure you add your Supabase project's domain `<project-id>.supabase.co`. Configure the non-sensitive scopes by making sure the following ones are selected: `.../auth/userinfo.email`, `.../auth/userinfo.profile`, `openid`. If you're selecting other sensitive scopes, your app may require additional verification. In those cases, it's best to use [custom domains](/docs/guides/platform/custom-domains).
    3. Finally, add the client ID and secret from step 1 in the [Google provider on the Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers).

  <TabPanel id="swift" label="Swift">

    Google sign-in with Supabase is done through the [GoogleSignIn-iOS](https://github.com/google/GoogleSignIn-iOS) package.

    When the user provides consent, Google issues an identity token (commonly abbreviated as ID token) that is then sent to your project's Supabase Auth server. When valid, a new user session is started by issuing an access and refresh token from Supabase Auth.

    Follow the code sample below to implement native Google sign-in with Supabase in your iOS app.

    ```swift
    import GoogleSignIn

    class GoogleSignInViewController: UIViewController {
      ...

      func googleSignIn() async throws {
        let result = try await GIDSignIn.sharedInstance.signIn(withPresenting: self)

        guard let idToken = result.user.idToken?.tokenString else {
          print("No idToken found.")
          return
        }

        let accessToken = result.user.accessToken.tokenString

        try await supabase.auth.signInWithIdToken(
          credentials: OpenIDConnectCredentials(
            provider: .google,
            idToken: idToken,
            accessToken: accessToken
          )
        )
      }
      ...

    }
    ```

    ### Configuration [#ios-configuration]

    1. Follow the integration instructions on the [get started with Google Sign-In](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/ios/start-integrating) for iOS guide.
    2. Configure the [OAuth Consent Screen](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent). This information is shown to the user when giving consent to your app. In particular, make sure you have set up links to your app's privacy policy and terms of service.
    3. Add only the web client ID from step 1 in the [Google provider on the Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers), under _Authorized Client IDs_. Enable the `Skip nonce check` option.

    ### Using Google sign-in on Android

    1. Configure OAuth credentials for your Google Cloud project in the [Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) page of the console. You need two client IDs, a web client ID and Android client ID. When creating a new Android OAuth client ID, use the instructions on screen to provide the SHA-1 certificate fingerprint used to sign your Android app.
    2. Configure the [OAuth Consent Screen](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent). This information is shown to the user when giving consent to your app. In particular, make sure you have set up links to your app's privacy policy and terms of service.
    3. Finally, add the web client ID from step 1 in the [Google provider on the Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers), under _Authorized Client IDs_.

    Note that you do not have to configure the OAuth flow in the Supabase Dashboard in order to use native sign in.

    ### Using Google sign-in with Kotlin Multiplatform

    1. Configure OAuth credentials for your Google Cloud project in the [Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) page of the console. When creating a new OAuth client ID, choose _Android_ or _iOS_ depending on the mobile operating system your app is built for.

      - For Android, use the instructions on screen to provide the SHA-1 certificate fingerprint used to sign your Android app.
      - For iOS, use the instructions on screen to provide the app Bundle ID, and App Store ID and Team ID if the app is already published on the Apple AppStore.

    2. Configure the [OAuth Consent Screen](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent). This information is shown to the user when giving consent to your app. In particular, make sure you have set up links to your app's privacy policy and terms of service.
    3. Finally, add the client ID from step 1 in the [Google provider on the Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers), under _Authorized Client IDs_.

    Note that you do not have to configure the OAuth flow in the Supabase Dashboard in order to use native sign in.

  </TabPanel>

  <TabPanel id="chrome-extensions" label="Chrome Extensions">

    You will need to configure a client ID for your Chrome extension:

    1. Configure OAuth credentials for your Google Cloud project in the [Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) page of the console. When creating a new OAuth client ID, choose _Chrome extension_ for the application type. For _Item ID_ provide the unique ID of your Chrome extension. You can get this by calling `chrome.runtime.id` within the extension, or from the Web Store URL of the extension. For example, the [Google Translate extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-translate/aapbdbdomjkkjkaonfhkkikfgjllcleb) has the Web Store URL `https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-translate/aapbdbdomjkkjkaonfhkkikfgjllcleb` and the last part `aapbdbdomjkkjkaonfhkkikfgjllcleb` is its unique ID.
    2. Configure the [OAuth Consent Screen](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent). This information is shown to the user when giving consent to your app.
    3. Finally, add the client ID from step 1 in the [Google provider on the Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers), under _Authorized Client IDs_.

    Note that you do not have to configure the OAuth flow in the Supabase Dashboard to sign in with Google inside Chrome extensions.

## Signing users in

  queryGroup="platform"
>
<TabPanel id="web" label="Web">

### Application code

To use your own application code for the signin button, call the `signInWithOAuth` method (or the equivalent for your language).

```js
supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({
  provider: 'google',
})
```

For an implicit flow, that's all you need to do. The user will be taken to Google's consent screen, and finally redirected to your app with an access and refresh token pair representing their session.

<OAuthPkceFlow />

After a successful code exchange, the user's session will be saved to cookies.

### Saving Google tokens

The tokens saved by your application are the Supabase Auth tokens. Your app might additionally need the Google OAuth 2.0 tokens to access Google services on the user's behalf.

On initial login, you can extract the `provider_token` from the session and store it in a secure storage medium. The session is available in the returned data from `signInWithOAuth` (implicit flow) and `exchangeCodeForSession` (PKCE flow).

Google does not send out a refresh token by default, so you will need to pass parameters like these to `signInWithOAuth()` in order to extract the `provider_refresh_token`:

```js
const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({
  provider: 'google',
  options: {
    queryParams: {
      access_type: 'offline',
      prompt: 'consent',
    },
  },
})
```

### Google pre-built

Most web apps and websites can utilize Google's [personalized sign-in buttons](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/personalized-button), [One Tap](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/features) or [automatic sign-in](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/automatic-sign-in-sign-out) for the best user experience.

1. Load the Google client library in your app by including the third-party script:

   ```html
   <script src="https://accounts.google.com/gsi/client" async></script>
   ```

1. Use the [HTML Code Generator](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/tools/configurator) to customize the look, feel, features and behavior of the Sign in with Google button.
1. Pick the _Swap to JavaScript callback_ option, and input the name of your callback function. This function will receive a [`CredentialResponse`](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/reference/js-reference#CredentialResponse) when sign in completes.

   To make your app compatible with Chome's third-party-cookie phase-out, make sure to set `data-use_fedcm_for_prompt` to `true`.

   Your final HTML code might look something like this:

   ```html
   <div
     id="g_id_onload"
     data-client_id="<client ID>"
     data-context="signin"
     data-ux_mode="popup"
     data-callback="handleSignInWithGoogle"
     data-nonce=""
     data-auto_select="true"
     data-itp_support="true"
     data-use_fedcm_for_prompt="true"
   ></div>

   <div
     class="g_id_signin"
     data-type="standard"
     data-shape="pill"
     data-theme="outline"
     data-text="signin_with"
     data-size="large"
     data-logo_alignment="left"
   ></div>
   ```

1. Create a `handleSignInWithGoogle` function that takes the `CredentialResponse` and passes the included token to Supabase. The function needs to be available in the global scope for Google's code to find it.

   ```ts
   async function handleSignInWithGoogle(response) {
     const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithIdToken({
       provider: 'google',
       token: response.credential,
     })
   }
   ```

1. _(Optional)_ Configure a nonce. The use of a nonce is recommended for extra security, but optional. The nonce should be generated randomly each time, and it must be provided in both the `data-nonce` attribute of the HTML code and the options of the callback function.

   ```ts
   async function handleSignInWithGoogle(response) {
     const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithIdToken({
       provider: 'google',
       token: response.credential,
       nonce: '<NONCE>',
     })
   }
   ```

   Note that the nonce should be the same in both places, but because Supabase Auth expects the provider to hash it (SHA-256, hexadecimal representation), you need to provide a hashed version to Google and a non-hashed version to `signInWithIdToken`.

   You can get both versions by using the in-built `crypto` library:

   ```js
   // Adapted from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SubtleCrypto/digest#converting_a_digest_to_a_hex_string

   const nonce = btoa(
     String.fromCharCode(...crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(32))),
   );
   const encoder = new TextEncoder();
   const encodedNonce = encoder.encode(nonce);
   crypto.subtle.digest("SHA-256", encodedNonce).then((hashBuffer) => {
     const hashArray = Array.from(new Uint8Array(hashBuffer));
     const hashedNonce = hashArray
       .map((b) => b.toString(16).padStart(2, "0"))
       .join("");
   }

   // Use 'hashedNonce' when making the authentication request to Google
   // Use 'nonce' when invoking the supabase.auth.signInWithIdToken() method
   ```

</TabPanel>

<TabPanel id="react-native" label="Expo React Native">

Unlike the OAuth flow which requires the use of a web browser, the native Sign in with Google flow on Android uses the [operating system's built-in functionalities](https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/auth/api/identity/package-summary) to prompt the user for consent. Note that native sign-in has been rebranded as _One Tap sign-in on Android_ by Google, which you should not confuse with _One Tap sign in for web_, as mentioned below.

When the user provides consent, Google issues an identity token (commonly abbreviated as ID token) that is then sent to your project's Supabase Auth server. When valid, a new user session is started by issuing an access and refresh token from Supabase Auth.

When working with Expo, you can use the [`react-native-google-signin/google-signin` library](https://github.com/react-native-google-signin/google-signin#expo-installation) library to obtain an ID token that you can pass to supabase-js [`signInWithIdToken` method](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signinwithidtoken).

Follow the [Expo installation docs](https://react-native-google-signin.github.io/docs/setting-up/expo) for installation and configuration instructions. See the [supabase-js reference](/docs/reference/javascript/initializing?example=react-native-options-async-storage) for instructions on initializing the supabase-js client in React Native.

```tsx ./components/Auth.native.tsx
import {
  GoogleSignin,
  GoogleSigninButton,
  statusCodes,
} from '@react-native-google-signin/google-signin'
import { supabase } from '../utils/supabase'

export default function () {
  GoogleSignin.configure({
    scopes: ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly'],
    webClientId: 'YOUR CLIENT ID FROM GOOGLE CONSOLE',
  })

  return (
    <GoogleSigninButton
      size={GoogleSigninButton.Size.Wide}
      color={GoogleSigninButton.Color.Dark}
      onPress={async () => {
        try {
          await GoogleSignin.hasPlayServices()
          const userInfo = await GoogleSignin.signIn()
          if (userInfo.idToken) {
            const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithIdToken({
              provider: 'google',
              token: userInfo.idToken,
            })
            console.log(error, data)
          } else {
            throw new Error('no ID token present!')
          }
        } catch (error: any) {
          if (error.code === statusCodes.SIGN_IN_CANCELLED) {
            // user cancelled the login flow
          } else if (error.code === statusCodes.IN_PROGRESS) {
            // operation (e.g. sign in) is in progress already
          } else if (error.code === statusCodes.PLAY_SERVICES_NOT_AVAILABLE) {
            // play services not available or outdated
          } else {

<TabPanel id="flutter" label="Flutter">

### iOS and Android

Google sign-in with Supabase is done through the [google_sign_in](https://pub.dev/packages/google_sign_in) package for iOS and Android.

When the user provides consent, Google issues an identity token (commonly abbreviated as ID token) that is then sent to your project's Supabase Auth server. When valid, a new user session is started by issuing an access and refresh token from Supabase Auth.

Follow the code sample below to implement native Google sign-in with Supabase in your Flutter iOS and Android app.

```dart
import 'package:google_sign_in/google_sign_in.dart';
import 'package:supabase_flutter/supabase_flutter.dart';

...
Future<void> _nativeGoogleSignIn() async {
  /// TODO: update the Web client ID with your own.
  ///
  /// Web Client ID that you registered with Google Cloud.
  const webClientId = 'my-web.apps.googleusercontent.com';

  /// TODO: update the iOS client ID with your own.
  ///
  /// iOS Client ID that you registered with Google Cloud.
  const iosClientId = 'my-ios.apps.googleusercontent.com';

  final GoogleSignIn googleSignIn = GoogleSignIn(
    clientId: iosClientId,
    serverClientId: webClientId,
  );
  final googleUser = await googleSignIn.signIn();
  final googleAuth = await googleUser!.authentication;
  final accessToken = googleAuth.accessToken;
  final idToken = googleAuth.idToken;

  if (accessToken == null) {
    throw 'No Access Token found.';
  }
  if (idToken == null) {
    throw 'No ID Token found.';
  }

  await supabase.auth.signInWithIdToken(
    provider: OAuthProvider.google,
    idToken: idToken,
    accessToken: accessToken,
  );
}
...
```

### Web, macOS, Windows, and Linux

Google sign-in with Supabase on Web, macOS, Windows, and Linux is done through the [signInWithOAuth](docs/reference/dart/auth-signinwithoauth) method.

This method of signing in is web based, and will open a browser window to perform the sign in. For non-web platforms, the user is brought back to the app via [deep linking](/docs/guides/auth/native-mobile-deep-linking?platform=flutter).

```dart
supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth(
  OAuthProvider.google,
  redirectTo: 'my-scheme://login-callback',
);
```

This call takes the user to Google's consent screen. Once the flow ends, the user's profile information is exchanged and validated with Supabase Auth before it redirects back to your Flutter application with an access and refresh token representing the user's session.

### Using Google sign-in on Android

The Sign in with Google flow on Android uses the [operating system's built-in functionalities](https://developer.android.com/training/sign-in/credential-manager) to prompt the user for consent.

When the user provides consent, Google issues an identity token (commonly abbreviated as ID token) that is then sent to your project's Supabase Auth server. When valid, a new user session is started by issuing an access and refresh token from Supabase Auth.

**Note:** You have to create OAuth client IDs for both a Web and Android application. The Web client ID is the one used in your Android app.

Add the following dependencies to your app. You can find the latest version of `credentials` [here](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/credentials) and `googleid` [here](https://developers.google.com/identity/android-credential-manager/releases).

```kotlin
implementation("androidx.credentials:credentials:<latest version>")
implementation ("com.google.android.libraries.identity.googleid:googleid:<latest version>")

// optional - needed for credentials support from play services, for devices running
// Android 13 and below.
implementation("androidx.credentials:credentials-play-services-auth:<latest version>")
```

Add the following proguard rules to your `proguard-rules.pro` file:

```proguard
-if class androidx.credentials.CredentialManager
-keep class androidx.credentials.playservices.** {
  *;
}
```

Follow the code sample below to implement native Google sign-in with Supabase using Credential Manager in your Android app.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun GoogleSignInButton() {
    val coroutineScope = rememberCoroutineScope()
    val context = LocalContext.current

    val onClick: () -> Unit = {

### Using Google sign-in with Kotlin Multiplatform

When using [Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-multiplatform/), you can use the [compose-auth](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/kotlin/installing) plugin. On Android it uses the Credential Manager automatically and on other platforms it uses `auth.signInWith(Google)`.

**Initialize the Supabase Client**

**Note:** You have to create OAuth credentials for both a Web and Android application. [Learn more](https://developers.google.com/identity/one-tap/android/get-started#api-console)

```kotlin
val supabaseClient = createSupabaseClient(
    supabaseUrl = "SUPABASE_URL",
    supabaseKey = "SUPABASE_KEY"
) {
    install(GoTrue)
    install(ComposeAuth) {
        nativeGoogleLogin("WEB_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID") //Use the Web Client ID, not the Android one!
    }
}
```

**Use the Compose Auth plugin in your Auth Screen**

```kotlin
val authState = supabaseClient.composeAuth.rememberLoginWithGoogle(
    onResult = {
        when(it) { //handle errors
            NativeSignInResult.ClosedByUser -> TODO()
            is NativeSignInResult.Error -> TODO()
            is NativeSignInResult.NetworkError -> TODO()
            NativeSignInResult.Success -> TODO()
        }
    }
)

Button(onClick = { authState.startFlow() }) {
    Text("Sign in with Google")
}
```

### Using native sign in for Chrome extensions

Similar to the native sign in for Android, you can use the Chrome browser's [identity APIs](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/identity/) to launch an authentication flow.

First, you need to configure your `manifest.json` file like so:

```json
{
  "permissions": ["identity"],
  "oauth2": {
    "client_id": "<client ID>",
    "scopes": ["openid", "email", "profile"]
  }
}
```

Then you should call the [`chrome.identity.launchWebAuthFlow()`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/identity/#method-launchWebAuthFlow) function to trigger the sign in flow. On success, call the `supabase.auth.signInWithIdToken()` function to complete sign in with your Supabase project.

```ts
const manifest = chrome.runtime.getManifest()

const url = new URL('https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth')

url.searchParams.set('client_id', manifest.oauth2.client_id)
url.searchParams.set('response_type', 'id_token')
url.searchParams.set('access_type', 'offline')
url.searchParams.set('redirect_uri', `https://${chrome.runtime.id}.chromiumapp.org`)
url.searchParams.set('scope', manifest.oauth2.scopes.join(' '))

chrome.identity.launchWebAuthFlow(
  {
    url: url.href,
    interactive: true,
  },
  async (redirectedTo) => {
    if (chrome.runtime.lastError) {
      // auth was not successful
    } else {
      // auth was successful, extract the ID token from the redirectedTo URL
      const url = new URL(redirectedTo)
      const params = new URLSearchParams(url.hash)

      const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithIdToken({
        provider: 'google',
        token: params.get('id_token'),
      })
    }
  }
)
```
