To enable Discord Auth for your project, you need to set up a Discord Application and add the Application OAuth credentials to your Supabase Dashboard.

## Overview

Setting up Discord logins for your application consists of 3 parts:

- Create and configure a Discord Application [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers)
- Add your Discord OAuth Consumer keys to your [Supabase Project](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
- Add the login code to your [Supabase JS Client App](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js)

## Access your Discord account

- Go to [discord.com](https://discord.com/).
- Click on `Login` at the top right to log in.

When your user signs in, call [signInWithOAuth()](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signinwithoauth) with `discord` as the `provider`:

```js
async function signInWithDiscord() {
  const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({
    provider: 'discord',
  })
}
```

</TabPanel>

When your user signs in, call [signInWith(Provider)](/docs/reference/kotlin/auth-signinwithoauth) with `Discord` as the `Provider`:

```kotlin
suspend fun signInWithDiscord() {
	supabase.auth.signInWith(Discord)
}
```

</TabPanel>

If your user is already signed in, Discord prompts the user again for authorization.

```js
async function signOut() {
  const { error } = await supabase.auth.signOut()
}
```
