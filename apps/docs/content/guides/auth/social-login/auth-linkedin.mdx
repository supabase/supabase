To enable LinkedIn Auth for your project, you need to set up a LinkedIn OAuth application and add the application credentials to your Supabase Dashboard.

## Overview

<Admonition type="caution">

We will be replacing the existing _LinkedIn_ provider with a new _LinkedIn (OIDC)_ provider. Developers with LinkedIn OAuth Applications created prior to 1st August 2023 should create a new OAuth application and migrate their credentials from the _LinkedIn_ provider to the _LinkedIn (OIDC)_ provider. Alternatively, you can also add the newly released `Sign In with LinkedIn using OpenID Connect` to your existing OAuth application. [Read this section](/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-linkedin#linkedin-open-id-connect-oidc) to find out more.

</Admonition>

Setting up LinkedIn logins for your application consists of 3 parts:

- Create and configure a LinkedIn Project and App on the [LinkedIn Developer Dashboard](https://www.linkedin.com/developers/apps).
- Add your _LinkedIn (OIDC)_ `client_id` and `client_secret` to your [Supabase Project](https://supabase.com/dashboard).
- Add the login code to your [Supabase JS Client App](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js).

## Access your LinkedIn Developer account

- Go to [LinkedIn Developer Dashboard](https://www.linkedin.com/developers/apps).
- Log in (if necessary.)

## Find your callback URL

<SocialProviderSetup provider="LinkedIn" />

## Create a LinkedIn OAuth app

- Go to [LinkedIn Developer Dashboard](https://www.linkedin.com/developers/apps).
- Click on `Create App` at the top right
- Enter your `LinkedIn Page` and `App Logo`
- Save your app
- Click `Products` from the top menu
- Look for `Sign In with LinkedIn using OpenID Connect` and click on Request Access
- Click `Auth` from the top menu
- Add your `Redirect URL` to the `Authorized Redirect URLs for your app` section
- Copy and save your newly-generated `Client ID`
- Copy and save your newly-generated `Client Secret`

Ensure that the appropriate scopes have been added under OAuth 2.0 Scopes at the bottom of the `Auth` screen.

When your user signs in, call [signInWithOAuth()](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signinwithoauth) with `linkedin_oidc` as the `provider`:

```js
async function signInWithLinkedIn() {
  const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({
    provider: 'linkedin_oidc',
  })
}
```

When your user signs in, call [signInWith(Provider)](/docs/reference/kotlin/auth-signinwithoauth) with `LinkedIn` as the `Provider`:

```kotlin

## LinkedIn Open ID Connect (OIDC)

We will be replacing the _LinkedIn_ provider with a new _LinkedIn (OIDC)_ provider to support recent changes to the LinkedIn [OAuth APIs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/shared/authentication/authorization-code-flow?context=linkedin%2Fcontext&tabs=HTTPS1). The new provider utilizes the [Open ID Connect standard](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/consumer/integrations/self-serve/sign-in-with-linkedin-v2#validating-id-tokens). In view of this change, we have disabled edits on the _LinkedIn_ provider and will be removing it effective 4th January 2024. Developers with LinkedIn OAuth Applications created prior to 1st August 2023 should create a new OAuth application [via the steps outlined above](/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-linkedin#create-a-linkedin-oauth-app) and migrate their credentials from the _LinkedIn_ provider to the _LinkedIn (OIDC)_ provider. Alternatively, you can also head to the `Products` section and add the newly release`Sign In with LinkedIn using OpenID Connect` to your existing OAuth application.

Developers using the Supabase CLI to test their LinkedIn OAuth application should also update their `config.toml` to make use of the new provider:

```
[auth.external.linkedin_oidc]
enabled = true
client_id = ...
secret = ...
```

Do reach out to support if you have any concerns around this change.
