To enable Spotify Auth for your project, you need to set up a Spotify OAuth application and add the application credentials to your Supabase Dashboard.

## Overview

Setting up Spotify logins for your application consists of 3 parts:

- Create and configure a Spotify Project and App on the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/).
- Add your Spotify `API Key` and `API Secret Key` to your [Supabase Project](https://supabase.com/dashboard).
- Add the login code to your [Supabase JS Client App](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js).

## Access your Spotify Developer account

- Log into [Spotify](https://spotify.com)
- Access the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)

## Add login code to your client app

The following outlines the steps to sign in using Spotify with Supabase Auth.

1. Call the signin method from the client library.
1. The user is redirected to the Spotify login page.
1. After completing the sign-in process, the user will be redirected to your app with an error that says the email address needs to be confirmed. Simultaneously the user receives a confirmation email from Supabase Auth.
1. The user clicks the confirmation link in the email.
1. The user is brought back to the app and is now signed in.

When your user signs in, call [signInWithOAuth()](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signinwithoauth) with `spotify` as the `provider`:

```js
async function signInWithSpotify() {
  const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({
    provider: 'spotify',
  })
}
```

When your user signs in, call [signInWith(Provider)](/docs/reference/kotlin/auth-signinwithoauth) with `Spotify` as the `Provider`:

}
```

```js
async function signOut() {
  const { error } = await supabase.auth.signOut()
}
```
