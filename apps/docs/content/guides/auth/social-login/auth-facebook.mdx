To enable Facebook Auth for your project, you need to set up a Facebook OAuth application and add the application credentials to your Supabase Dashboard.

## Overview

Setting up Facebook logins for your application consists of 3 parts:

- Create and configure a Facebook Application on the [Facebook Developers Site](https://developers.facebook.com)
- Add your Facebook keys to your [Supabase Project](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
- Add the login code to your [Supabase JS Client App](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js)

## Access your Facebook Developer account

- Go to [developers.facebook.com](https://developers.facebook.com).
- Click on `Log In` at the top right to log in.

## Create a Facebook app

- Click on `My Apps` at the top right.
- Click `Create App` near the top right.
- Select your app type and click `Continue`.
- Fill in your app information, then click `Create App`.
- This should bring you to the screen: `Add Products to Your App`. (Alternatively you can click on `Add Product` in the left sidebar to get to this screen.)

<SocialProviderSetup provider="Facebook" />

## Set up Facebook login for your Facebook app

From the `Add Products to your App` screen:

- Click `Setup` under `Facebook Login`
- Skip the Quickstart screen, instead, in the left sidebar, click `Settings` under `Facebook Login`
- Enter your callback URI under `Valid OAuth Redirect URIs` on the `Facebook Login Settings` page
- Enter this in the `Valid OAuth Redirect URIs` box
- Click `Save Changes` at the bottom right

Be aware that you have to set the right use case permissions to enable Third party applications to read the email address. To do so:

Under `Build Your App`, click on `Use Cases` screen. From there, do the following steps:

- Click the Edit button in `Authentication and Account Creation` on the right side. This action will lead to the other page.
- `public_profile` is set by default, so make sure it and `email` have status of **Ready for testing** in the redirected page.
- If not, click the **Add** button in email on right side.

## Copy your Facebook app ID and secret

- Click `Settings / Basic` in the left sidebar
- Copy your App ID from the top of the `Basic Settings` page
- Under `App Secret` click `Show` then copy your secret
- Make sure all required fields are completed on this screen.

## Enter your Facebook app ID and secret into your Supabase project

## Add login code to your client app

When your user signs in, call [signInWithOAuth()](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signinwithoauth) with `facebook` as the `provider`:

```js
async function signInWithFacebook() {
  const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({
    provider: 'facebook',
  })
}
```

When your user signs in, call [signInWith(Provider)](/docs/reference/kotlin/auth-signinwithoauth) with `Facebook` as the `Provider`:

```kotlin
suspend fun signInWithFacebook() {
	supabase.auth.signInWith(Facebook)
}
```

When your user signs out, call [signOut()](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signout) to remove them from the browser session and any objects from localStorage:

```js
async function signOut() {
  const { error } = await supabase.auth.signOut()
}
```

When your user signs out, call [logout()](/docs/reference/kotlin/auth-signout) to remove them from the browser session and any objects from localStorage:

```kotlin
suspend fun signOut() {

}
```

Now, you should be able to login with Facebook and alert you to `Submit for Login Review` when users try to sign into your app. Follow the instructions there to make your app go live for full features and products.
