title: 'Identities'
---

An identity is an authentication method associated with a user. Supabase Auth supports the following types of identity:

- Email
- Phone
- OAuth
- SAML

A user can have more than one identity. Anonymous users have no identity until they link an identity to their user.

## The user identity object

The user identity object contains the following attributes:

| Attributes      | Type     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| --------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| id              | `string` | The provider id returned by the provider. If the provider is an OAuth provider, the id refers to the user's account with the OAuth provider. If the provider is `email` or `phone`, the id is the user's id from the `auth.users` table. |
| user_id         | `string` | The user's id that the identity is linked to.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| identity_data   | `object` | The identity metadata. For OAuth and SAML identities, this contains information about the user from the provider.                                                                                                                        |

| created_at      | `string` | The timestamp that the identity was created.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
