A **user** in Supabase Auth is someone with a user ID, stored in the Auth schema. Once someone is a user, they can be issued an Access Token, which can be used to access Supabase endpoints. The token is tied to the user, so you can restrict access to resources via [RLS policies](/docs/guides/database/postgres/row-level-security).

## Permanent and anonymous users

Supabase distinguishes between permanent and anonymous users.

- **Permanent users** are tied to a piece of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), such as an email address, a phone number, or a third-party identity. They can use these identities to sign back into their account after signing out.
- **Anonymous users** aren't tied to any identities. They have a user ID and a personalized Access Token, but they have no way of signing back in as the same user if they are signed out.

Anonymous users are useful for:

- E-commerce applications, to create shopping carts before checkout
- Full-feature demos without collecting personal information
- Temporary or throw-away accounts

See the [Anonymous Signins guide](/docs/guides/auth/auth-anonymous) to learn more about anonymous users.

<Admonition type="caution" title="Anonymous users do not use the anon role">

Just like permanent users, anonymous users use the **authenticated** role for database access.

The **anon** role is for those who aren't signed in at all and are not tied to any user ID. We refer to these as unauthenticated or public users.

## The user object

The user object stores all the information related to a user in your application. The user object can be retrieved using one of these methods:

1. [`supabase.auth.getUser()`](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-getuser)
2. Retrieve a user object as an admin using [`supabase.auth.admin.getUserById()`](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-admin-listusers)

A user can sign in with one of the following methods:

- Password-based method (with email or phone)
- Passwordless method (with email or phone)
- OAuth
- SAML SSO

An identity describes the authentication method that a user can use to sign in. A user can have multiple identities. These are the types of identities supported:

- Email
- Phone
- OAuth
- SAML

<Admonition type="note">

A user with an email or phone identity will be able to sign in with either a password or passwordless method (e.g. use a one-time password (OTP) or magiclink). By default, a user with an unverified email or phone number will not be able to sign in.

The user object contains the following attributes:
