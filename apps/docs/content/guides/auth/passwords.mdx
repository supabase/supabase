Using passwords to authenticate users is a tried-and-tested method to give your users access to your application. Supabase Auth provides you with secure configuration options and uses best practices to store and verify your user's passwords.

## Password security

A password is more secure if it is harder to guess or brute-force. In theory, a password is harder to guess if it is longer. It is also harder to guess if it uses a larger set of characters (for example, digits, lowercase and uppercase letters, and symbols).

This table shows the _minimum_ number of guesses that need to be tried to access a user's account:

| Required characters                          | Length | Guesses          |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------ | ---------------- |
| Digits only                                  | 8      | ~ 2<sup>27</sup> |
| Digits and letters                           | 8      | ~ 2<sup>41</sup> |
| Digits, lower and uppercase letters          | 8      | ~ 2<sup>48</sup> |
| Digits, lower and uppercase letters, symbols | 8      | ~ 2<sup>52</sup> |

In reality though, passwords are not always generated at random. They often contain variations of names, words, dates, and common phrases. Malicious actors can use these properties to guess a password in fewer attempts.

There are hundreds of millions (and growing!) known passwords out there. Malicious actors can use these lists of leaked passwords to automate login attempts (known as credential stuffing) and steal or access sensitive user data.

### Password strength and leaked password protection

To help protect your users, Supabase Auth allows you fine-grained control over the strength of the passwords used on your project. You can configure these in your project's [Auth settings](/dashboard/project/_/settings/auth):

- Set a large minimum password length. Anything less than 8 characters is not recommended.
- Set the required characters that must appear at least once in a user's password. Use the strongest option of requiring digits, lowercase and uppercase letters, and symbols.
- Prevent the use of leaked passwords. Supabase Auth uses the open-source [HaveIBeenPwned.org Pwned Passwords API](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords) to reject passwords that have been leaked and are known by malicious actors.

### Additional recommendations

In addition to choosing suitable password strength settings and preventing the use of leaked passwords, consider asking your users to:

- Use a password manager to store and generate passwords.
- Avoid password reuse across websites and apps.
- Avoid using personal information in passwords.
- Use [Multi-Factor Authentication](/docs/guides/auth/auth-mfa).

## Resetting a user's password (forgot password)

Strong passwords are difficult to remember, so Supabase Auth provides you with APIs to build a secure password reset flow.

### Overview

To add a secure password reset flow to your application:

1. Build the **password reset page**:
   - Should be publicly accessible and contain a form asking for the user's email address.
   - Use the [`supabase.auth.resetPasswordForEmail`](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-resetpasswordforemail) API to request a password reset link for a user's email address.
   - Specify the `redirectTo` parameter when calling this API to point to the URL of the **change password page.**
2. Build the **password change page**:
   - Should be accessible only to authenticated users.
   - Add its URL to the allowed [Redirect URLs](/dashboard/project/_/auth/url-configuration) settings.
   - Show a form or other prompt asking the user to choose a new password.
   - Call the [`supabase.auth.updateUser`](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-updateuser) API to set a new password for the user.

The email link sent to your users works in the same way as [passwordless authentication](/docs/guides/auth/passwordless-login):

1. After a user visits the **reset password page**, they are sent a reset password link.
   - If you use PKCE (default), this link only works on the device or browser where the original reset request was made. Display a message to the user to make sure they don't change devices or browsers.
   - If you use the implicit grant flow, the link can be opened on any device.
2. A user clicks the link. They are taken to Supabase Auth, which validates the link.
   - If the link is valid, it redirects to the **change password page**, which you specified in the `redirectTo` parameter.
   - If the **change password page's** URL is not properly registered in the [Redirect URLs](/dashboard/project/_/auth/url-configuration) configuration, the user is taken to the default Site URL page.
3. Supabase Auth redirects to the **change password page** including [session](/docs/guides/auth/sessions) information in the URL.
   - If you used PKCE (default), the redirect contains the `code` query param.
   - If you are not using official Supabase libraries, or have a custom setup, extract the `code` from the URL and call the [`supabase.auth.exchangeCodeForSession`](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-exchangecodeforsession) API.
   - Official Supabase libraries handle code the code exchange for you.
   - If you used the implicit flow, the redirect contains a URL fragment encoding the user's [session](/docs/guides/auth/sessions).

## Frequently asked questions

### How are passwords stored?

Supabase Auth uses [bcrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt), a strong password hashing function, to store hashes of users' passwords. Only hashed passwords are stored. You cannot impersonate a user with the password hash. Each hash is accompanied by a randomly generated salt parameter for extra security.

The hash is stored in the `encrypted_password` column of the `auth.users` table. The column's name is a misnomer (cryptographic hashing is not encryption), but is kept for backward compatibility.

### How will strengthened password requirements affect current users?

Existing users can still sign in with their current password even if it doesn't meet the new, strengthened password requirements. However, if their password falls short of these updated standards, they will encounter a `WeakPasswordError` during the `signInWithPassword` process, explaining why it's considered weak. This change is also applicable to new users and existing users changing their passwords, ensuring everyone adheres to the enhanced security standards.
