You can view your users on the [Users page](/dashboard/project/_/auth/users) of the Dashboard. You can also view the contents of the Auth schema in the [Table Editor](/dashboard/project/_/editor).

## Accessing user data via API

For security, the Auth schema is not exposed in the auto-generated API. If you want to access users data via the API, you can create your own user tables in the `public` schema.

Make sure to protect the table by enabling [Row Level Security](/docs/guides/database/postgres/row-level-security). Reference the `auth.users` table to ensure data integrity. Specify `on delete cascade` in the reference. For example, a `public.profiles` table might look like this:

```sql
create table public.profiles (
  id uuid not null references auth.users on delete cascade,
  first_name text,
  last_name text,

  primary key (id)
);

alter table public.profiles enable row level security;
```

<Admonition type="caution">

Only use primary keys as [foreign key references](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-fk.html) for schemas and tables like `auth.users` which are managed by Supabase. Postgres lets you specify a foreign key reference for columns backed by a unique index (not necessarily primary keys).

Primary keys are **guaranteed not to change**. Columns, indices, constraints or other database objects managed by Supabase **may change at any time** and you should be careful when referencing them directly.

</Admonition>

To update your `public.profiles` table every time a user signs up, set up a trigger. If the trigger fails, it could block signups, so test your code thoroughly.

```sql
-- inserts a row into public.profiles
create function public.handle_new_user()
returns trigger
language plpgsql
security definer set search_path = ''
as $$
begin
  insert into public.profiles (id, first_name, last_name)
  values (new.id, new.raw_user_meta_data ->> 'first_name', new.raw_user_meta_data ->> 'last_name');
  return new;
end;
$$;

-- trigger the function every time a user is created
create trigger on_auth_user_created
  after insert on auth.users
  for each row execute procedure public.handle_new_user();
```

## Adding and retrieving user metadata

You can assign metadata to users on sign up:

## Deleting users

You may delete users directly or via the management console at Authentication > Users. Note that deleting a user from the `auth.users` table does not automatically sign out a user. As Supabase makes use of JSON Web Tokens (JWT), a user's JWT will remain "valid" until it has expired.

<Admonition type="caution">

You cannot delete a user if they are the owner of any objects in Supabase Storage.

You will encounter an error when you try to delete an Auth user that owns any Storage objects. If this happens, try deleting all the objects for that user, or reassign ownership to another user.

</Admonition>

## Exporting users

As Supabase is built on top of Postgres, you can query the `auth.users` and `auth.identities` table via the `SQL Editor` tab to extract all users:

```sql
select * from auth.users;
```

You can then export the results as CSV.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How to disable/remove the user data management triggers on the auth.users table?

Supabase Auth uses your project's database to store user data. It relies on the `auth` schema, and Supabase restricts access to the `auth` schema to prevent unintended custom changes that could break the functionality of the Auth service.

If you want to disable or remove the custom triggers on the `auth.users` table you created, you must cascade-delete the trigger function.

```sql
drop function public.handle_new_user cascade;
```

This command still works because the `postgres` role has the ownership of `public.handle_new_user()` function, and the `cascade` clause will drop the trigger indirectly.

### Running into **database errors** when creating/updating/deleting users.

Errors in your custom user management logic can cause unexpected issues when creating, updating or deleting users. Here are some common examples.

- Failed to create user: Database error creating new user
- Failed to update user: Error updating user
- Failed to delete user: Database error deleting user

If you encounter a similar error, check your project's [auth logs](/dashboard/project/_/logs/auth-logs). Expanding the error log will display more details about what caused the issue.

**Example error messages:**

```
failed to close prepared statement: ERROR: current transaction is aborted, commands ignored until
 end of transaction block (SQLSTATE 25P02): ERROR: relation \"public.profiles\" does not exist (SQLSTATE 42P01)
```

```
ERROR: column \"updated_at\" of relation \"profiles\" does not exist (SQLSTATE 42703)
```

Use the hints provided in the error message to fix issues in your custom user management logic.
