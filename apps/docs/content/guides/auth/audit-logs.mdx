Auth audit logs provide comprehensive tracking of authentication events in your Supabase project. Audit logs are automatically captured for all authentication events and help you monitor user authentication activities, detect suspicious behavior, and maintain compliance with security requirements.

## What gets logged

Supabase auth audit logs automatically capture all authentication events including:

- User signups and logins
- Password changes and resets
- Email verification events
- Token refresh and logout events

## Storage options

By default, audit logs are stored in two places:

1. **Your project's Postgres database** - Stored in the `auth.audit_log_entries` table, searchable via SQL but uses database storage
2. **External log storage** - Cost-efficient storage accessible through the dashboard

You can disable Postgres storage to reduce database storage costs while keeping the external log storage.

### Configuring audit log storage

1. Navigate to your project dashboard
2. Go to **Authentication**
3. Find the **Audit Logs** under **Configuration** section
4. Toggle on "Disable writing auth audit logs to project database" to disable database storage

<Admonition type="tip">

Disabling Postgres storage reduces your database storage costs. Audit logs will still be available through the dashboard.
