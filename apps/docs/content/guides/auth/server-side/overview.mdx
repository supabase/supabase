When using Supabase with server-side languages and frameworks - such as Next.js, SvelteKit and Remix - it is important to configure your Supabase client to use cookies for storing user sessions. We have developed an `@supabase/ssr` package to make this process as simple as possible. This package is currently in `beta`. Adoption is recommended but be aware that the API is still unstable and may have breaking changes in the future.

## Framework quickstarts

<div className="grid cols-[repeat(auto-fit,min-max(250px,1fr)] gap-6 mb-6 not-prose">
  {[
    {
      title: 'Next.js',
      href: '/guides/auth/server-side/nextjs',
      description:
        'Automatically configure Supabase to use cookies, making your user and their session available on the client and server.',
      icon: '/docs/img/icons/nextjs-icon',
    },
  ].map((item) => {
    return (
      <Link href={`${item.href}`} key={item.title} passHref>
        <GlassPanel title={item.title} background={false} icon={item.icon}>
          {item.description}
        </GlassPanel>
      </Link>
    )
  })}
</div>

<Admonition type="note">

If you're currently using the [Auth Helpers package](https://github.com/supabase/auth-helpers), the [docs are still available](/docs/guides/auth/auth-helpers), however we recommend migrating to the new `@supabase/ssr` package as this will be the recommended path moving forward.
