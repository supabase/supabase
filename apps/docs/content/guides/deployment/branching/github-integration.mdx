Supabase Branching uses the Supabase GitHub integration to read files from your GitHub repository. With this integration, Supabase watches all commits, branches, and pull requests of your GitHub repository.

## Installation

In the Supabase Dashboard:

1. Go to **Project Settings** > [**Integrations**](/dashboard/project/_/settings/integrations).
2. Under **GitHub Integration**, click **Authorize GitHub**.
3. You are redirected to a GitHub authorization page. Click **Authorize Supabase**.
4. You are redirected back to the Integrations page. Choose a GitHub repository to connect your project to.
5. Fill in the relative path to the Supabase directory from your repository root.
6. Configure the other options as needed to automate your GitHub connection.
7. Click **Enable integration**.

## Syncing GitHub branches

Enable the **Automatic branching** option in your GitHub Integration configuration to automatically sync GitHub branches with Supabase branches.

When a new branch is created in GitHub, a corresponding branch is created in Supabase. (You can enable the **Supabase changes only** option to only create Supabase branches when Supabase files change.)

### Configuration

You can test configuration changes on your Preview Branch by configuring the `config.toml` file in your Supabase directory. See the [Configuration docs](/docs/guides/deployment/branching/configuration) for more information.

A comment is added to your PR with the deployment status of your preview branch.

### Migrations

The migrations in the `migrations` subdirectory of your Supabase directory are automatically run.

### Seeding

No production data is copied to your Preview branch. This is meant to protect your sensitive production data.

You can seed your Preview Branch with sample data using the `seed.sql` file in your Supabase directory. See the [Seeding docs](/docs/guides/local-development/seeding-your-database) for more information.

Data changes in your seed files are not merged to production.

## Deploying changes to production

Enable the **Deploy to production** option in your GitHub Integration configuration to automatically deploy changes when you push or merge to production branch.

The following changes are deployed:

- New migrations are applied
- Edge Functions declared in `config.toml` are deployed
- Storage buckets declared in `config.toml` are deployed

All other configurations, including API, Auth, and seed files, are ignored by default.

## Preventing migration failures

We highly recommend turning on a 'required check' for the Supabase integration. You can do this from your GitHub repository settings. This prevents PRs from being merged when migration checks fail, and stops invalid migrations from being merged into your production branch.

### Email notifications

To catch failures early, we also recommend subscribing to email notifications on your branch. Common errors include migration conflict, function deployment failure, or invalid configuration file.

You can setup a custom GitHub Action to monitor the status of any Supabase Branch.

```yaml name=.github/workflows/notify-failure.yaml
name: Branch Status

on:
  pull_request:
    types:
      - opened
      - reopened
      - synchronize
    branches:
      - main
      - develop
    paths:
      - 'supabase/**'

jobs:
  failed:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: fountainhead/action-wait-for-check@v1.2.0
        id: check
        with:
          checkName: Supabase Preview
          ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha || github.sha }}
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

      - if: ${{ steps.check.outputs.conclusion == 'failure' }}
        run: exit 1
```
