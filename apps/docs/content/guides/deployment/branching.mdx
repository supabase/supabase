subtitle: 'Use Supabase Branches to test and preview changes'

Use branching to safely experiment with changes in your Supabase project.

Supabase Branches create separate environments that branch off from your main project. These environments allow you to develop and test changes—such as new configurations, database schemas, or features—without impacting your production setup. When you're ready to ship, you can merge your branch to apply the changes to your production project.

## How branching works

- **Separate Environments**  
  Each branch is a fully isolated environment with its own Supabase instance and API credentials.

- **Preview Branches**  
  You can create multiple preview branches for short-lived testing and experimentation.

- **Persistent Branches**  
  Persistent branches are long-lived environments. They are not automatically paused or deleted due to inactivity or after merging.

- **Managing Branches**  
  You can create, review, and merge branches either automatically through our [GitHub integration](/docs/guides/deployment/branching/github-integration) or directly through the [Supabase Dashboard](/docs/guides/deployment/branching/dashboard) (currently in beta).  
  All branches appear on the branches page in the dashboard, regardless of how they were created.

- **Data-less by Default**  
  New branches do not include data from your main project. This design helps protect sensitive production data.  
  If you want your branches to start with data, you can use a [seed file](/docs/guides/deployment/branching/github-integration#seeding) when using the GitHub integration.

## Deploying to production

When you merge a branch into your main project, Supabase automatically runs a deployment workflow to apply your changes to production. This workflow is implemented as a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**, where each node represents a deployment step.

### Deployment steps

1. **Clone**  
   Checks out your repository at the specified Git branch  
   _(Optional when using [Branching via Dashboard](/docs/guides/deployment/branching/dashboard))_

2. **Pull**  
   Retrieves database migrations from your main project and initializes the migration history table  
   _(Initialization applies when using Branching via Dashboard)_

3. **Health**  
   Waits up to 2 minutes for all Supabase services on your branch to become healthy, including Auth, API, Database, Storage, and Realtime

4. **Configure**  
   Updates service configurations based on your `config.toml` file  
   _(Available only for [Branching via GitHub](/docs/guides/deployment/branching/github-integration))_

5. **Migrate**  
   Applies pending database migrations and Vault secrets to your branch

6. **Seed**  
   Runs seed files to populate the branch with initial data  
   _(Must be [enabled in `config.toml`](/docs/guides/deployment/branching/configuration#branch-configuration-with-remotes) for persistent branches)_

7. **Deploy**  
   Deploys updated Edge Functions and applies function secrets

If a parent deployment step fails, all dependent steps are skipped.  
For example, if database migrations fail at step 5, the seed step (step 6) will not run.

When using the GitHub integration, this same deployment workflow runs automatically on every commit pushed to your Git branch.
