Use branching to safely experiment with changes to your Supabase project.

Supabase branches create separate environments that spin off from your main project. You can use these branching environments to create and test changes like new configurations, database schemas, or features without affecting your production setup. When you're ready to ship your changes, merge your branch to update your production instance with the new changes.

## How branching works

- **Separate Environments**: Each branch is a separate environment with its own Supabase instance and API credentials.
- **Preview Branches**: You can create multiple Preview Branches for testing.
- **Persistent Branches**: Persistent branches are long-lived branches. They aren't automatically paused or deleted due to non-inactivity or merging.
- **Managing Branches**: You can create, review, and merge branches either automatically via our [GitHub integration](/docs/guides/deployment/branching/github-integration) or directly [through the dashboard](/docs/guides/deployment/branching/dashboard) (currently in beta). All branches show up in the branches page in the dashboard, regardless of how they were created.
- **Data-less**: New branches do not start with any data from your main project. This is meant to better protect your sensitive production data. To start your branches with data, you can use a [seed file](/docs/guides/deployment/branching/github-integration#seeding) if using the GitHub integration.

## Deployment workflow overview

When you push changes to a connected branch, Supabase automatically runs a deployment workflow consisting some or all of the following deployment steps.

1. **Clone** - Checks out your repository at the specified git branch (optional for [Branching via Dashboard](/docs/guides/deployment/branching/dashboard))
2. **Pull** - Retrieves database migrations from your base project (also initialises the migration history table when [Branching via Dashboard](/docs/guides/deployment/branching/dashboard))
3. **Health** - Waits up to 2 minutes for all Supabase services on your branch to be running and healthy, including Auth, API, Database, Storage, and Realtime
4. **Configure** - Updates service configurations based on your config.toml file (not available for [Branching via Dashboard](/docs/guides/deployment/branching/dashboard) at the moment)
5. **Migrate** - Applies pending database migrations and vault secrets to your branch
6. **Seed** - Runs seed files to populate your branch with initial data (must be [enabled in config.toml](/docs/guides/deployment/branching/configuration#branch-configuration-with-remotes) for persistent branches)
7. **Deploy** - Deploys any changed Edge Functions and updates function secrets

The deployment workflow is expressed as a Directed Acyclic Graph where each node represents a single deployment step. This means we can execute independent steps in parallel and skip children nodes when the parent fails. For e.g.. if your database migrations failed at step 5, we will skip step 6 and not seed your branch.

### Monitoring deployments

To check deployment status and troubleshoot failures:

1. Go to your project dashboard
2. Navigate to "Manage Branches"
3. Click on your branch to view deployment logs
4. Check the "View logs" section for detailed error messages

For programmatic monitoring, you can use the [Management API](https://api.supabase.com/api/v1#tag/environments/post/v1/projects/{ref}/branches) to poll branch status.

For detailed troubleshooting guidance, see our [Troubleshooting guide](/docs/guides/deployment/branching/troubleshooting).
