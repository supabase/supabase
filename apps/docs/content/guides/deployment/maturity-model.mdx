Supabase is great for building applications quickly _and_ for scaling them over time. However, as your application matures and your team grows, the practices you use to manage production systems should evolve beyond the approaches used during early prototyping.

This guide outlines recommended practices as your project progresses through different stages of maturity.

## Prototyping

The Dashboard is a fast and convenient way to build applications during the prototyping phase. That said, we strongly recommend using [Database Migrations](/docs/guides/deployment/database-migrations) to manage schema changes—even early on.

You can use the Supabase CLI to [capture changes](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-db-diff) made through the Dashboard and commit them to a version control system such as Git. This ensures your database changes are reproducible and traceable from the beginning.

## Collaborating

Once you begin collaborating with other team members, **all project changes should be tracked in version control**.

At this stage, we strongly recommend moving away from using the Dashboard for schema changes. Instead, use migrations to manage your database and commit them to your repository so every change is reviewed, tracked, and auditable.

**Resources:**

- [Database migrations](/docs/guides/deployment/database-migrations)
- [Managing access on the Dashboard](/docs/guides/platform/access-control)
- [PGAudit for Postgres](/docs/guides/database/extensions/pgaudit)

## In production

When your application is live, you should **never** make database changes directly through the Dashboard. All changes should be applied using [migrations](/docs/guides/cli/managing-environments#create-a-new-migration).

Additional best practices to follow in production include:

- Use the Dashboard’s [access levels](/docs/guides/platform/access-control) to prevent unauthorized or accidental changes.
- Design a [safe workflow](/docs/guides/platform/shared-responsibility-model#you-decide-your-own-workflow) for managing database changes. We strongly recommend using [multiple environments](/docs/guides/cli/managing-environments) as part of your development process (`local` → `staging` → `production`).
- Never share production credentials, especially your `postgres` password. All changes should be applied via version-controlled migrations executed through a bastion host or a CI/CD platform such as [GitHub Actions](/docs/guides/cli/managing-environments#configure-github-actions).  
  When using GitHub Actions, enable [approval workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/reviewing-deployments) to prevent accidental deployments.
- Restrict access to your production database using [Network Restrictions](/docs/guides/platform/network-restrictions).
- As your database grows, we strongly recommend enabling [Point-in-Time Recovery](/docs/guides/platform/backups#point-in-time-recovery). This provides safer recovery options with minimal performance impact during maintenance.
- Review the [Production Checklist](/docs/guides/platform/going-into-prod) and ensure your team understands the [Shared Responsibility Model](/docs/guides/platform/shared-responsibility-model) between your organization and Supabase.

## Enterprise

For organizations with stricter security requirements, consider running workloads across multiple Supabase organizations. A common pattern is to maintain a dedicated Production organization that is accessible only to team members who are qualified to manage live systems.
