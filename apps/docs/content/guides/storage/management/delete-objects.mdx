When you delete one or more objects from a bucket, the files are permanently removed and not recoverable. You can delete a single object or multiple objects at once.

<Admonition type="note">

Deleting objects should always be done via the **Storage API** and NOT via a **SQL query**. Deleting objects via a SQL query will not remove the object from the bucket and will result in the object being orphaned.

</Admonition>

## Delete objects

To delete one or more objects, use the `remove` method.

```javascript
await supabase.storage.from('bucket').remove(['object-key-1', 'object-key-2'])
```

## RLS

To delete an object, the user must have the `delete` permission on the object. For example:

```sql
create policy "User can delete their own objects"
on storage.objects
for delete
TO authenticated
USING (
    owner_id = (select auth.uid())
);
```
