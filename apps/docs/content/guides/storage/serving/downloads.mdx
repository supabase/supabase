## Public buckets

As mentioned in the [Buckets Fundamentals](/docs/guides/storage/buckets/fundamentals) all files uploaded in a public bucket are publicly accessible and benefit a high CDN cache HIT ratio.

You can access them by using this conventional URL:

```
https://[project_id].supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/[bucket]/[asset-name]
```

You can also use the Supabase SDK `getPublicUrl` to generate this url for you

```js
const { data } = supabase.storage.from('bucket').getPublicUrl('filePath.jpg')

console.log(data.publicUrl)
```

### Downloading

If you want the browser to start an automatic download of the asset instead of trying serving it, you can add the `?download` querystring parameter.

By default it will use the asset name to save the file on disk. You can optionally pass a custom name to the `download` parameter as following: `?download=customname.jpg`

## Private buckets

Assets stored in a non-public bucket are considered private and are not accessible via a public url like the public buckets.

You can access them only by:

- Signing a time limited URL on the Server, for example with Edge Functions.
- with a GET request the url `https://[project_id].supabase.co/storage/v1/object/authenticated/[bucket]/[asset-name]` and the user Authorization header

### Signing URLs

You can sign a time-limited URL that you can share to your users by invoking the `createSignedUrl` method on the SDK.

```js
const { data, error } = await supabase.storage
  .from('bucket')
  .createSignedUrl('private-document.pdf', 3600)

if (data) {
  console.log(data.signedUrl)
}
```
