You can use the S3 protocol to upload files to Supabase Storage. To get started with S3, see the [S3 setup guide](/docs/guides/storage/s3/authentication).

The S3 protocol supports file upload using:

- A single request
- Multiple requests via Multipart Upload

## Single request uploads

The `PutObject` action uploads the file in a single request. This matches the behavior of the Supabase SDK [Standard Upload](/docs/guides/storage/uploads/standard-uploads).

Use `PutObject` to upload smaller files, where retrying the entire upload won't be an issue. The maximum file size on paid plans is 5 GB.

For example, using JavaScript and the `aws-sdk` client:

```javascript
import { S3Client, PutObjectCommand } from '@aws-sdk/client-s3'

const s3Client = new S3Client({...})

const file = fs.createReadStream('path/to/file')

const uploadCommand = new PutObjectCommand({
  Bucket: 'bucket-name',
  Key: 'path/to/file',
  Body: file,
  ContentType: 'image/jpeg',
})

await s3Client.send(uploadCommand)
```

## Multipart uploads

Multipart Uploads split the file into smaller parts and upload them in parallel, maximizing the upload speed on a fast network. When uploading large files, this allows you to retry the upload of individual parts in case of network issues.

This method is preferable over [Resumable Upload](/docs/guides/storage/uploads/resumable-uploads) for server-side uploads, when you want to maximize upload speed at the cost of resumability. The maximum file size on paid plans is 50 GB.

### Upload a file in parts

Use the `Upload` class from an S3 client to upload a file in parts. For example, using JavaScript:

```javascript
import { S3Client } from '@aws-sdk/client-s3'
import { Upload } from '@aws-sdk/lib-storage'

const s3Client = new S3Client({...})

const file = fs.createReadStream('path/to/very-large-file')

const upload = new Upload(s3Client, {
  Bucket: 'bucket-name',
  Key: 'path/to/file',
  ContentType: 'image/jpeg',
  Body: file,
})

await uploader.done()
```

### Aborting multipart uploads

All multipart uploads are automatically aborted after 24 hours. To abort a multipart upload before that, you can use the [`AbortMultipartUpload`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_AbortMultipartUpload.html) action.
