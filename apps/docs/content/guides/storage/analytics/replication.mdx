Expect rapid changes, limited features, and possible breaking updates. [Share feedback](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/40116) as the experience is refined and access is expanded.

By combining replication powered by [Supabase ETL](https://github.com/supabase/etl) with **Analytics Buckets**, you can build an end-to-end data warehouse solution that automatically syncs changes from your Postgres database to Iceberg tables.

This guide provides a quickstart for replicating to Analytics Buckets. For complete replication configuration including other destinations, see the [Replication Setup Guide](/docs/guides/database/replication/replication-setup).

## How it works

The replication pipeline captures changes (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) from your Postgres database in real-time using Postgres logical replication and writes them to your analytics bucket. This allows you to maintain an always-up-to-date data warehouse without impacting your production workloads.

## Setup steps

### Step 1: Create an Analytics bucket

First, create a new analytics bucket to store your replicated data:

1. Navigate to **Storage** in the Supabase Dashboard.
2. Click **Create Bucket**.
3. Enter a name (e.g., `my-warehouse`).
4. Select **Analytics Bucket** as the type.
5. Click **Create**.

### Step 2: Create a publication

A publication defines which tables and change types will be replicated. Create one using SQL in the Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Create publication for tables you want to replicate
CREATE PUBLICATION pub_warehouse
  FOR TABLE users, orders, products;
```

This publication will track all changes (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) for the specified tables. For advanced publication options like column filtering and row predicates, see the [Replication Setup Guide](/docs/guides/database/replication/replication-setup#advanced-publication-options).

### Step 3: Create the replication pipeline

Now set up the pipeline to sync data to your analytics bucket:

1. Navigate to **Database > Replication** in the Supabase Dashboard.
2. Click **Create Pipeline**.
3. Select the **Publication** you created in Step 2.
4. Select your **Analytics Bucket** as the destination.
5. Configure any additional settings as needed.
6. Click **Create and Start**.

## Monitoring your pipeline

Once started, you can monitor the pipeline status directly in the **Database > Replication** section:

- **Status** - Shows if the pipeline is running, paused, or encountered errors
- **Sync Progress** - View the number of records replicated
- **Logs** - Check detailed logs for troubleshooting

<Admonition type="note">

Deleted tables are automatically recreated by the pipeline. To permanently delete a table, pause the pipeline first or remove it from the publication before deleting. See the [FAQ](/docs/guides/database/replication/replication-faq#what-happens-if-i-delete-a-table-at-the-destination) for details.
