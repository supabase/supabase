Analytics buckets use [Apache Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org/), an open-table format for managing large analytical datasets.
You can interact with them using tools such as [PyIceberg](https://py.iceberg.apache.org/), [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) or any client which supports the [standard Iceberg REST Catalog API](https://editor-next.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/iceberg/main/open-api/rest-catalog-open-api.yaml).

You can create an Analytics Bucket using either the Supabase SDK or the Supabase Dashboard.

### Using the Supabase SDK

```ts
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

const supabase = createClient('https://your-project.supabase.co', 'your-service-key')

supabase.storage.createBucket('my-analytics-bucket', {
  type: 'ANALYTICS',
})
```

{/* Changes */}

### Using the Supabase Dashboard

1. Navigate to the Storage section in the Supabase Dashboard.
2. Click on "Create Bucket".
3. Enter a name for your bucket (e.g., my-analytics-bucket).
4. Select "Analytics Bucket" as the bucket type.

Now, that you have created your Analytics Bucket, you can start [connecting to it](/docs/guides/storage/analytics/connecting-to-analytics-bucket) with Iceberg clients like PyIceberg or Apache Spark.
