<Admonition type="caution" title="This feature is in alpha">

Expect rapid changes, limited features, and possible breaking updates.  [share feedback](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/40116) as we refine the experience and expand access.

</Admonition>

When interacting with analytics buckets, you authenticate against two main services - the Iceberg REST Catalog and the S3-Compatible Storage Endpoint.

The **Iceberg REST Catalog** acts as the central management system for Iceberg tables. It allows Iceberg clients, such as PyIceberg and Apache Spark, to perform metadata operations including:

- Creating and managing tables and namespaces
- Tracking schemas and handling schema evolution
- Managing partitions and snapshots
- Ensuring transactional consistency and isolation

The REST Catalog itself does not store the actual data. Instead, it stores metadata describing the structure, schema, and partitioning strategy of Iceberg tables.

Actual data storage and retrieval operations occur through the separate S3-compatible endpoint, optimized for reading and writing large analytical datasets stored in Parquet files.

## Authentication

To connect to an Analytics Bucket, you need

- An Iceberg client (Spark, PyIceberg, etc) which supports the REST Catalog interface.
- S3 credentials to authenticate your Iceberg client with the underlying S3 Bucket.
  To create S3 Credentials go to [**Project Settings > Storage**](/dashboard/project/_/storage/settings), for more information, see the [S3 Authentication Guide](/docs/guides/storage/s3/authentication). We will support other authentication methods in the future.

- The project reference and Service key for your Supabase project.
  You can find your Service key in the Supabase Dashboard under [**Project Settings > API**.](/dashboard/project/_/settings/api-keys)

You now have an **Access Key** and a **Secret Key** that you can use to authenticate your Iceberg client.


## Connecting to the Iceberg REST Catalog directly

To authenticate with the Iceberg REST Catalog directly, you need to provide a valid Supabase **Service key** as a Bearer token.

```
curl \
  --request GET -sL \
  --url 'https://<your-supabase-project>.supabase.co/storage/v1/iceberg/v1/config?warehouse=<bucket-name>' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <your-service-key>'
```
