Vector buckets have default limits during the alpha phase. These limits are designed to ensure fair resource allocation and can be adjusted on a case-by-case basis for production workloads.

## Storage limits

| ----------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Buckets per project** | 10           | Maximum number of vector buckets per Supabase project |
| **Indexes per bucket**  | 10           | Maximum number of indexes per bucket                  |
| **Vector dimensions**   | Max 4096     | Maximum dimension size for embeddings                 |
