Storage uses Postgres to store metadata regarding your S3 buckets and objects. Users can use RLS (Row-Level Security) policies for access control. This data is stored in a dedicated schema within your project called `storage`.

<Admonition type="note">

When working with SQL, it's crucial to consider all records in Storage tables as read-only. All operations, including uploading, copying, moving, and deleting, should **exclusively go through the Supabase Storage API**.

This is important because the storage schema only stores the metadata and the actual objects are stored in S3 buckets. Deleting the database metadata doesn't remove the S3 object in the underlying storage provider. This results in your object being inaccessible, but you'll still be billed for it.

Here is the schema that represents the Storage service:

You have the option to query this table directly to retrieve information about your files in Storage without the need to go through our API.

## Modifying the schema

As of April 2025, the internal Supabase schemas have [restricted access](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/34270) to prevent unintentional damage by users. We strongly recommend refraining from making any alterations to the `storage` schema and treating it as read-only.

However, we encourage you to add custom indexes as they can significantly improve the performance of the RLS policies you create for enforcing access control.
