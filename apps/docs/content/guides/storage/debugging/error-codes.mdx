## Storage Error Codes

<Admonition type="note">
  We are transitioning to a new error code system. For backwards compatibility you'll still be able
  to see the old error codes
</Admonition>

Error codes in Storage are returned as part of the response body. They are useful for debugging and understanding what went wrong with your request.
The error codes are returned in the following format:

```json
{
  "code": "error_code",
  "message": "error_message"
}
```

Here is the full list of error codes and their descriptions:

| ErrorCode                 | Description                                                     | StatusCode | Resolution                                                                                                                                                                                           |

## Legacy Error Codes

As we are transitioning to a new error code system, you might still see the following error format:

```json
{
  "httpStatusCode": 400,
  "code": "error_code",
  "message": "error_message"
}
```

Here's a list of the most common error codes and their potential resolutions:

### 404 not_found

Indicates that the resource is not found or you don't have the correct permission to access it
**Resolution:**

- Add a RLS policy to grant permission to the resource. See our [Access Control docs](/docs/guides/storage/uploads/access-control) for more information.
- Ensure you include the user `Authorization` header
- Verify the object exists

### 409 already_exists

Indicates that the resource already exists.
**Resolution:**

- Use the `upsert` functionality in order to overwrite the file. Find out more [here](/docs/guides/storage/uploads/standard-uploads#overwriting-files).

### 403 unauthorized

You don't have permission to action this request
**Resolution:**

- Add RLS policy to grant permission. See our [Access Control docs](/docs/guides/storage/security/access-control) for more information.
- Ensure you include the user `Authorization` header

### 429 too many requests

This problem typically arises when a large number of clients are concurrently interacting with the Storage service, and the pooler has reached its `max_clients` limit.

**Resolution:**

- Increase the max_clients limits of the pooler.
- Upgrade to a bigger project compute instance [here](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/addons).

### 544 database_timeout

This problem arises when a high number of clients are concurrently using the Storage service, and Postgres doesn't have enough available connections to efficiently handle requests to Storage.

**Resolution:**

- Increase the pool_size limits of the pooler.
- Upgrade to a bigger project compute instance [here](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/addons).

### 500 internal_server_error

This issue occurs where there is a unhandled error.
**Resolution:**

- File a support ticket to Storage team [here](https://supabase.com/dashboard/support/new)
