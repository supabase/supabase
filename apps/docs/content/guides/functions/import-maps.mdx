Developing with Edge Functions is similar to developing with Node.js, but with a few key differences. This guide will help you understand how to manage your dependencies.

## Importing dependencies

Supabase Edge Functions support:

- The Deno [standard library](https://deno.land/std)
- Third party [modules](https://deno.land/x)
- Built-in [Node APIs](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/node/compatibility)
- Node.js modules published to npm

You can import npm modules using the `npm:` specifier or via CDNs like [esm.sh](https://esm.sh). For example, to import the `supabase-js` package:

```ts
import { createClient } from 'npm:@supabase/supabase-js@2'
```

If you are migrating an existing Node app and if it uses a built-in Node APIs, you can import them to Deno using `node:` specifiers. For example, if your code uses `process.env`, you can import it as follows:

```ts
import process from 'node:process'
```

You can learn more about `npm:` specifiers and Node built-in APIs, in [Deno's documentation](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/node/npm_specifiers).

## Importing types

If your [environment is set up properly](/docs/guides/functions/local-development) and the module you're importing is exporting types, the import will have types and autocompletion support.

Some npm packages may not ship out of the box types and you may need to import them from a separate package. You can specify their types with a `@deno-types` directive:

```ts
// @deno-types="npm:@types/express@^4.17"
import express from 'npm:express@^4.17'
```

To include types for built-in Node APIs, add the following line to the top of your imports:

```ts
/// <reference types="npm:@types/node" />
```

## Using import maps

An [Import Map](https://github.com/WICG/import-maps#the-import-map) is similar to a `package.json` file. They are a way to manage your dependencies. Consider this code:

```ts
// without import maps:
import lodash from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/lodash'

// with import maps:
import lodash from 'lodash'
```

You can accomplish this using an Import Map, which is a JSON file with the following:

```json supabase/functions/import_map.json
{
  "imports": {
    "lodash": "https://cdn.skypack.dev/lodash"
  }
}
```

We recommend creating one `import_map.json` within the `/supabase/functions` folder, similar to a `package.json` file, to define imports that can be used across all of your project's functions.

```bash
└── supabase
    ├── functions
    │   ├── import_map.json # A top-level import map to use across functions..
    │   ├── function-one
    │   │   └── index.ts
    └── config.toml
```

Alternatively, you can create one `import_map.json` file in each function folder, which will take priority over a top-level file.

You can override this default behavior by providing the `--import-map <string>` flag to the `serve` and `deploy` commands.

### Configuring VSCode

In order for vscode to understand the imports correctly, you need to specify the `deno.importMap` flag in your `.vscode/settings.json` file:

```json settings.json
{
  "deno.enable": true,
  "deno.unstable": true,
  "deno.importMap": "./supabase/functions/import_map.json"
}
```
