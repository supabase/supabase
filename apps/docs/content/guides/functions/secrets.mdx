It's common that you will need to use sensitive information or environment-specific variables inside your Edge Functions. You can access these using Deno's built-in handler

```js
Deno.env.get(MY_SECRET_NAME)
```

## Default secrets

Edge Functions have access to these secrets by default:

- `SUPABASE_URL`: The API gateway for your Supabase project.
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: The `anon` key for your Supabase API. This is safe to use in a browser when you have [Row Level Security](/docs/guides/auth/row-level-security) enabled.
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: The `service_role` key for your Supabase API. This is safe to use in Edge Functions, but it should NEVER be used in a browser. This key will bypass [Row Level Security](/docs/guides/auth/row-level-security).
- `SUPABASE_DB_URL`: The URL for your [PostgreSQL database](/docs/guides/database). You can use this to connect directly to your database.

## Local secrets

You can load environment variables in two ways:

1. Through an `.env` file placed at `supabase/functions/.env`, which is automatically loaded on `supabase start`
2. Through the `--env-file` option for `supabase functions serve`, for example: `supabase functions serve --env-file ./path/to/.env-file`

Let's create a local file for storing our secrets, and inside it we can store a secret `MY_NAME`:

```bash
echo "MY_NAME=Yoda" >> ./supabase/.env.local
```

This creates a new file `./supabase/.env.local` for storing your local development secrets.

Never check your .env files into Git!

Now let's access this environment variable `MY_NAME` inside our Function. Anywhere in your function, add this line:

```jsx
console.log(Deno.env.get('MY_NAME'))
```

Now we can invoke our function locally, by serving it with our new `.env.local` file:

```bash
supabase functions serve --env-file ./supabase/.env.local
```

When the function starts you should see the name “Yoda” output to the terminal.

## Production secrets

Let's create a `.env` for production. In this case we'll just use the same as our local secrets:

```bash
cp ./supabase/.env.local ./supabase/.env
```

This creates a new file `./supabase/.env` for storing your production secrets.

Never check your `.env` files into Git!

Let's push all the secrets from the `.env` file to our remote project using [`supabase secrets set`](/docs/reference/cli/usage#supabase-secrets-set):

```bash
supabase secrets set --env-file ./supabase/.env

# You can also set secrets individually using:
supabase secrets set MY_NAME=Chewbacca
```

You don't need to re-deploy after setting your secrets.

To see all the secrets which you have set remotely, use [`supabase secrets list`](/docs/reference/cli/usage#supabase-secrets-list):

```bash
supabase secrets list
```
