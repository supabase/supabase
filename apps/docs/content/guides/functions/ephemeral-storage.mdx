Edge Functions provides ephemeral file storage. You can read and write files to the `/tmp` directory.

This allows you to:

- Process uploaded files temporarily without permanent storage
- Handle complex file transformations and workflows
- Unzip archives and process contents before saving to database

---

## Overview

Ephemeral storage will reset on each function invocation. This means the files you write during an invocation can only be read within the same invocation.

You can use [Deno File System APIs](https://docs.deno.com/api/deno/file-system) or the [`node:fs`](https://docs.deno.com/api/node/fs/) module to access the `/tmp` path.

```tsx
Deno.serve(async (req) => {
  if (req.headers.get('content-type') !== 'application/zip') {
    return new Response('file must be a zip file', {
      status: 400,
    })
  }

  const uploadId = crypto.randomUUID()
  await Deno.writeFile('/tmp/' + uploadId, req.body)

  // E.g. extract and process the zip file
  const zipFile = await Deno.readFile('/tmp/' + uploadId)
  // You could use a zip library to extract contents
  const extracted = await extractZip(zipFile)

  // Or process the file directly
  console.log(`Processing zip file: ${uploadId}, size: ${zipFile.length} bytes`)
})
```

---

## Common use cases

### Archive processing with background tasks

You can use ephemeral storage with [Background Tasks](/docs/guides/functions/background-tasks) to handle large file processing operations that exceed memory limits.

Imagine you have a Photo Album application that accepts photo uploads as zip files. A streaming implementation will run into memory limit errors with zip files exceeding 100MB, as it retains all archive files in memory simultaneously.

You can write the zip file to ephemeral storage first, then use a background task to extract and upload files to Supabase Storage. This way, you only read parts of the zip file to the memory.

```tsx
import { BlobWriter, ZipReader } from 'https://deno.land/x/zipjs/index.js'
import { createClient } from 'jsr:@supabase/supabase-js@2'

const supabase = createClient(
  Deno.env.get('SUPABASE_URL'),
  Deno.env.get('SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY')
)

async function processZipFile(uploadId: string, filepath: string) {
  const file = await Deno.open(filepath, { read: true })
  const zipReader = new ZipReader(file.readable)
  const entries = await zipReader.getEntries()

  await supabase.storage.createBucket(uploadId, { public: false })

  await Promise.all(
    entries.map(async (entry) => {
      if (entry.directory) return

      // Read file entry from temp storage
      const blobWriter = new BlobWriter()
      const blob = await entry.getData(blobWriter)

      // Upload to permanent storage
      await supabase.storage.from(uploadId).upload(entry.filename, blob)

      console.log('uploaded', entry.filename)
    })
  )

  await zipReader.close()
}

Deno.serve(async (req) => {
  const uploadId = crypto.randomUUID()
  const filepath = `/tmp/${uploadId}.zip`

  // Write zip to ephemeral storage
  await Deno.writeFile(filepath, req.body)

  // Process in background to avoid memory limits
  EdgeRuntime.waitUntil(processZipFile(uploadId, filepath))

  return new Response(JSON.stringify({ uploadId }), {
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  })
})
```

### Image manipulation

Custom image manipulation workflows using [`magick-wasm`](/docs/guides/functions/examples/image-manipulation).

```tsx
Deno.serve(async (req) => {
  // Save uploaded image to temp storage
  const imagePath = `/tmp/input-${crypto.randomUUID()}.jpg`
  await Deno.writeFile(imagePath, req.body)

  // Process image with magick-wasm
  const processedPath = `/tmp/output-${crypto.randomUUID()}.jpg`
  // ... image manipulation logic

  // Read processed image and return
  const processedImage = await Deno.readFile(processedPath)
  return new Response(processedImage, {
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'image/jpeg' },
  })
})
```

## Limitations

Currently, the synchronous APIs for creating or writing files are not supported:

```tsx
// ❌ Not supported
Deno.writeFileSync('/tmp/file.txt', data)
Deno.mkdirSync('/tmp/directory')

// ✅ Supported
await Deno.writeFile('/tmp/file.txt', data)
await Deno.mkdir('/tmp/directory')
```

You can use sync variations of read APIs:

```tsx
// ✅ Supported
const data = Deno.readFileSync('/tmp/file.txt')
```

## Limits

- Free projects: Up to 256MB of ephemeral storage
- Paid projects: Up to 512MB of ephemeral storage
