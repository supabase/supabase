Once you have developed your Edge Functions locally, you can deploy them to your Supabase project.

<Admonition type="note">

Before getting started, make sure you have the Supabase CLI installed. Check out the CLI installation guide for installation methods and troubleshooting.

</Admonition>

---

## Step 1: Authenticate

Log in to the Supabase CLI if you haven't already:

```bash
supabase login
```

---

## Step 2: Connect your project

Get the project ID associated with your function:

```bash
supabase projects list
```

<Admonition type="tip" label="Need a new project?">

If you haven't yet created a Supabase project, you can do so by visiting [database.new](https://database.new).

</Admonition>

[Link](/docs/reference/cli/usage#supabase-link) your local project to your remote Supabase project using the ID you just retrieved:

```bash
supabase link --project-ref your-project-id
```

Now you should have your local development environment connected to your production project.

---

## Step 3: Deploy Functions

You can deploy all edge functions within the `functions` folder with a single command:

```bash
supabase functions deploy
```

Or deploy individual Edge Functions by specifying the function name:

```bash
supabase functions deploy hello-world
```

### Deploying public functions

By default, Edge Functions require a valid JWT in the authorization header. If you want to deploy Edge Functions without Authorization checks (commonly used for Stripe webhooks), you can pass the `--no-verify-jwt` flag:

```bash
supabase functions deploy hello-world --no-verify-jwt
```

<Admonition type="caution">

Be careful when using this flag, as it will allow anyone to invoke your Edge Function without a valid JWT. The Supabase client libraries automatically handle authorization.

</Admonition>

## Step 4: Verify successful deployment

ðŸŽ‰Â Your function is now live!

When the deployment is successful, your function is automatically distributed to edge locations worldwide. Your edge functions is now running globally at `https://[YOUR_PROJECT_ID].supabase.co/functions/v1/hello-world.`

---

## Step 5: Test your live function

You can now invoke your Edge Function using the project's `ANON_KEY`, which can be found in the [API settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/api) of the Supabase Dashboard. You can invoke it from within your app:

<$CodeTabs>

```bash name=cURL
curl --request POST 'https://<project_id>.supabase.co/functions/v1/hello-world' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer ANON_KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{ "name":"Functions" }'
```

```js name=JavaScript
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

// Create a single supabase client for interacting with your database
const supabase = createClient('https://xyzcompany.supabase.co', 'public-anon-key')

const { data, error } = await supabase.functions.invoke('hello-world', {
  body: { name: 'Functions' },
})
```

</$CodeTabs>

<Admonition type="note">

Note that the `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` is different in development and production. To get your production anon key, you can find it in your Supabase dashboard under Settings > API.

</Admonition>

You should now see the expected response:

```json
{ "message": "Hello Production!" }
```

<Admonition type="note">

You can also test the function through the Dashboard. To see how that works, check out the [Dashboard Quickstart guide](/docs/guides/dashboard/quickstart).

</Admonition>

## CI/CD deployment

You can use popular CI / CD tools like GitHub Actions, Bitbucket, and GitLab CI to automate Edge Function deployments.

### GitHub Actions

You can use the official [`setup-cli` GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/supabase-cli-action) to run Supabase CLI commands in your GitHub Actions.

The following GitHub Action deploys all Edge Functions any time code is merged into the `main` branch:

```yaml
name: Deploy Function

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    env:
      SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
      PROJECT_ID: your-project-id

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: supabase/setup-cli@v1
        with:
          version: latest

      - run: supabase functions deploy --project-ref $PROJECT_ID
```

---

### GitLab CI

Here is the sample pipeline configuration to deploy via GitLab CI.

```yaml
image: node:20

# List of stages for jobs, and their order of execution
stages:
  - setup
  - deploy

# This job runs in the setup stage, which runs first.
setup-npm:
  stage: setup
  script:
    - npm i supabase
  cache:
    paths:
      - node_modules/
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - node_modules/

# This job runs in the deploy stage, which only starts when the job in the build stage completes successfully.
deploy-function:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - npx supabase init
    - npx supabase functions deploy --debug
  services:
    - docker:dind
  variables:
    DOCKER_HOST: tcp://docker:2375
```

---

### Bitbucket Pipelines

Here is the sample pipeline configuration to deploy via Bitbucket.

```yaml
image: node:20

pipelines:
  default:
    - step:
        name: Setup
        caches:
          - node
        script:
          - npm i supabase
    - parallel:
        - step:
            name: Functions Deploy
            script:
              - npx supabase init
              - npx supabase functions deploy --debug
            services:
              - docker
```

---

### Function configuration

Individual function configuration like [JWT verification](/docs/guides/cli/config#functions.function_name.verify_jwt) and [import map location](/docs/guides/cli/config#functions.function_name.import_map) can be set via the `config.toml` file.

```toml
[functions.hello-world]
verify_jwt = false
```

This ensures your function configurations are consistent across all environments and deployments.

---

### Example

This example shows a GitHub Actions workflow that deploys all Edge Functions when code is merged into the `main` branch.

<$CodeSample
meta="deploy.yaml"
path="/edge-functions/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml"
