subtitle: 'Learn how to create, test, and deploy your first Edge Function using the Supabase CLI.'
---

Before getting started, make sure you have the **Supabase CLI installed**. Check out the [CLI installation guide](/docs/guides/cli) for installation methods and troubleshooting.

<Admonition type="tip" label="Prefer using the Supabase Dashboard?">

You can also create and deploy functions directly from the Supabase Dashboard. Check out our [Dashboard Quickstart guide](/docs/guides/functions/quickstart-dashboard).

</Admonition>

## Step 1: Create or configure your project

If you don't have a project yet, initialize a new Supabase project in your current directory.

```bash
supabase init my-edge-functions-project
cd my-edge-functions-project
```

Or, if you already have a project locally, navigate to your project directory. If your project hasn't been configured for Supabase yet, make sure to run the `supabase init` command.

```bash
cd your-existing-project
supabase init # Initialize Supabase, if you haven't already
```

<Admonition type="note">

After this step, you should have a project directory with a `supabase` folder containing `config.toml` and an empty `functions` directory.

</Admonition>

---

## Step 2: Create your first function

Within your project, generate a new Edge Function with a basic template:

```bash
supabase functions new hello-world
```

This creates a new function at `supabase/functions/hello-world/index.ts` with this starter code:

```tsx
Deno.serve(async (req) => {
  const { name } = await req.json()
  const data = {
    message: `Hello ${name}!`,
  }

  return new Response(JSON.stringify(data), { headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } })
})
```

This function accepts a JSON payload with a `name` field and returns a greeting message.

<Admonition type="note">

After this step, you should have a new file at `supabase/functions/hello-world/index.ts` containing the starter Edge Function code.

</Admonition>

---

## Step 3: Test your function locally

Start the local development server to test your function:

```bash
supabase start  # Start all Supabase services
supabase functions serve hello-world
```

<Admonition type="note" label="First time running Supabase services?">

The `supabase start` command downloads Docker images, which can take a few minutes initially.

</Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">

**Function not starting locally?**

- Make sure Docker is running
- Run `supabase stop` then `supabase start` to restart services

**Port already in use?**

- Check what's running with `supabase status`
- Stop other Supabase instances with `supabase stop`

</Admonition>

<Admonition type="note">

**Using Linux with SELinux?**

If you're on Fedora, RHEL, or another distro with SELinux enabled, Docker may not have permission to access your project files. Allow Docker to access your project files by updating their SELinux labels:

```bash
sudo chcon -Rt container_file_t $(pwd)
```
</Admonition>

Your function is now running at [`http://localhost:54321/functions/v1/hello-world`](http://localhost:54321/functions/v1/hello-world). Hot reloading is enabled, which means that the server will automatically reload when you save changes to your function code.

<Admonition type="note">

After this step, you should have all Supabase services running locally, and your Edge Function serving at the local URL. Keep these terminal windows open.

</Admonition>

---

## Step 4: Send a test request

Open a new terminal and test your function with curl:

<Admonition type="tip">

**Need your `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`?**

Run `supabase status` to see your local anon key and other credentials.

</Admonition>

```bash
curl -i --location --request POST 'http://localhost:54321/functions/v1/hello-world' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"name":"Functions"}'
```

After running this curl command, you should see:

```json
{ "message": "Hello Functions!" }
```

You can also try different inputs. Change `"Functions"` to `"World"` in the curl command and run it again to see the response change.

<Admonition type="note">

After this step, you should have successfully tested your Edge Function locally and received a JSON response with your greeting message.

</Admonition>

---

## Step 5: Connect to your Supabase project

To deploy your function globally, you need to connect your local project to a Supabase project.

<Admonition type="tip" label="Need to create new Supabase project?">

Create one at [database.new](https://database.new/).

</Admonition>

First, login to the CLI if you haven't already, and authenticate with Supabase. This opens your browser to authenticate with Supabase; complete the login process in your browser.

```bash
supabase login
```

Next, list your Supabase projects to find your project ID:

```bash
supabase projects list
```

Next, copy your project ID from the output, then connect your local project to your remote Supabase project. Replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` with the ID from the previous step.

```bash
supabase link --project-ref [YOUR_PROJECT_ID]
```

<Admonition type="note">

After this step, you should have your local project authenticated and linked to your remote Supabase project. You can verify this by running `supabase status`.

</Admonition>

---

## Step 6: Deploy to production

Deploy your function to Supabase's global edge network:

```bash
supabase functions deploy hello-world

# If you want to deploy all functions, run the `deploy` command without specifying a function name:
supabase functions deploy
```

<Admonition type="tip" label="Docker not required">

The CLI automatically falls back to API-based deployment if Docker isn't available. You can also explicitly use API deployment with the `--use-api` flag:

```bash
supabase functions deploy hello-world --use-api
```

</Admonition>

If you want to skip JWT verification, you can add the `--no-verify-jwt` flag for webhooks that don't need authentication:

```bash
supabase functions deploy hello-world --no-verify-jwt
```

<Admonition type="caution" label="Security Warning">

**Use `--no-verify-jwt` carefully.** It allows anyone to invoke your function without authentication!

</Admonition>

When the deployment is successful, your function is automatically distributed to edge locations worldwide.

<Admonition type="note">

Now, you should have your Edge Function deployed and running globally at `https://[YOUR_PROJECT_ID].supabase.co/functions/v1/hello-world`.

</Admonition>

---

## Step 7: Test your live function

🎉 Your function is now live! Test it with your project's anon key:

```bash
curl --request POST 'https://[YOUR_PROJECT_ID].supabase.co/functions/v1/hello-world' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"name":"Production"}'
```

**Expected response:**

```json
{ "message": "Hello Production!" }
```

<Admonition type="note" label="Production vs Development Keys">

The `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` is different in development and production. To get your production anon key, you can find it in your Supabase dashboard under **Settings > API**.

</Admonition>

Finally, you should have a fully deployed Edge Function that you can call from anywhere in the world.
