## Other limits & restrictions

- Serving of HTML content is only supported with [custom domains](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-domains) (Otherwise `GET` requests that return `text/html` will be rewritten to `text/plain`).
- Deno and Node file system APIs are not available.
- Web Worker API (or Node `vm` API) are not available.
