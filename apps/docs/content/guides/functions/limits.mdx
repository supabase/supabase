## Runtime limits

- Maximum Memory: 256MB
- Maximum Duration (Wall clock limit):
  This is the duration an Edge Function worker will stay active. During this period, a worker can serve multiple requests or process background tasks.
  - Free plan: 150s
  - Paid plans: 400s
- Maximum CPU Time: 2s (Amount of actual time spent on the CPU per request - does not include async I/O.)
- Request idle timeout: 150s (If an Edge Function doesn't send a response before the timeout, 504 Gateway Timeout will be returned)
- Maximum Function Size: 20MB (After bundling using CLI)
- Maximum log message length: 10,000 characters
- Log event threshold: 100 events per 10 seconds

## Other limits & restrictions

- Outgoing connections to ports `25` and `587` are not allowed.
- Serving of HTML content is only supported with [custom domains](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-domains) (Otherwise `GET` requests that return `text/html` will be rewritten to `text/plain`).
- Web Worker API (or Node `vm` API) are not available.
- Node Libraries that require multithreading are not supported. Examples: [libvips](https://github.com/libvips/libvips), [sharp](https://github.com/lovell/sharp).
