The Supabase CLI comes with a range of tools to help inspect your Postgres instances for potential issues. The CLI gets the information from <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/internals.html" target="_blank">Postgres internals</a>. Therefore, most tools provided are compatible with any Postgres databases regardless if they are a Supabase project or not.

You can find installation instructions for the the Supabase CLI <a href="/docs/guides/cli" target="_blank">here</a>.

### The `inspect db` command

The inspection tools for your Postgres database are under then `inspect db` command. You can get a full list of available commands by running `supabase inspect db help`.

```
$ supabase inspect db help
Tools to inspect your Supabase database

Usage:
  supabase inspect db [command]

Available Commands:
  bloat                Estimates space allocated to a relation that is full of dead tuples
  blocking             Show queries that are holding locks and the queries that are waiting for them to be released
  cache-hit            Show cache hit rates for tables and indices

...
```

### Connect to any Postgres database

Most inspection commands are Postgres agnostic. You can run inspection routines on any Postgres database even if it is not a Supabase project by providing a connection string via `--db-url`.

For example you can connect to your local Postgres instance:

```
supabase --db-url postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres inspect db bloat
```

### Connect to a Supabase instance

Working with Supabase, you can link the Supabase CLI with your project:

```
supabase link --project-ref <project-id>
```

Then the CLI will automatically connect to your Supabase project whenever you are in the project folder and you no longer need to provide `—db-url`.

## Inspection commands

Below are the db inspection commands provided, grouped by different use cases.

<Admonition type="note">

Some commands might require `pg_stat_statements` to be enabled or a specific Postgres version to be used.

### Disk storage

These commands are handy if you are running low on disk storage:

- [bloat](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-inspect-db-bloat) - estimates the amount of wasted space
- [vacuum-stats](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-inspect-db-vacuum-stats) - gives information on waste collection routines
- [table-record-counts](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-inspect-db-table-record-counts) - estimates the number of records per table
- [table-sizes](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-inspect-db-table-sizes) - shows the sizes of tables
- [index-sizes](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-inspect-db-index-sizes) - shows the sizes of individual index
- [table-index-sizes](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-inspect-db-table-index-sizes) - shows the sizes of indexes for each table

### Query performance

The commands below are useful if your Postgres database consumes a lot of resources like CPU, RAM or Disk IO. You can also use them to investigate slow queries.

- [cache-hit](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-inspect-db-cache-hit) - shows how efficient your cache usage is overall
- [unused-indexes](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-inspect-db-unused-indexes) - shows indexes with low index scans
- [index-usage](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-inspect-db-index-usage) - shows information about the efficiency of indexes
- [seq-scans](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-inspect-db-seq-scans) - show number of sequential scans recorded against all tables
- [long-running-queries](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-inspect-db-long-running-queries) - shows long running queries that are executing right now
- [outliers](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-inspect-db-outliers) - shows queries with high execution time but low call count and queries with high proportion of execution time spent on synchronous I/O

### Locks

- [locks](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-inspect-db-locks) - shows statements which have taken out an exclusive lock on a relation
- [blocking](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-inspect-db-blocking) - shows statements that are waiting for locks to be released

### Connections

- [role-connections](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-inspect-db-role-connections) - shows number of active connections for all database roles (Supabase-specific command)
- [replication-slots](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-inspect-db-replication-slots) - shows information about replication slots on the database

## Notes on `pg_stat_statements`

Following commands require `pg_stat_statements` to be enabled: calls, locks, cache-hit, blocking, unused-indexes, index-usage, bloat, outliers, table-record-counts, replication-slots, seq-scans, vacuum-stats, long-running-queries.

When using `pg_stat_statements` also take note that it only stores the latest 5,000 statements. Moreover, consider resetting the analysis after optimizing any queries by running `select pg_stat_statements_reset();`

Learn more about pg_stats [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/extensions/pg_stat_statements).
