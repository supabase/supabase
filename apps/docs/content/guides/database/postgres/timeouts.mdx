title: Timeouts
subtitle: Extend database timeouts to execute longer transactions
---

Requests made through the Supabase API and Dashboard have a timeout of 60 seconds. The database also has a global default timeout of 2 minutes.

To execute longer transactions, connect to your database using [Supavisor](/docs/guides/database/connecting-to-postgres#connection-pooler) or the [direct connection string](/docs/guides/database/connecting-to-postgres#direct-connections), and change the timeout settings.

## Change Postgres timeout

You can change the Postgres timeout at the:

1.  [Session level](#session-level)
1.  [Function level](#function-level)
1.  [Global level](#global-level)
1.  [Role level](#role-level)

### Session level

Session level settings persist only for the duration of the connection.

Set the session timeout by running:

```sql
set statement_timeout = '10min';
```

Because it applies to sessions only, it can only be used with connections through Supavisor in session mode (port 5432) or a direct connection. It cannot be used in the Dashboard, with the Supabase Client API, nor with Supavisor in Transaction mode (port 6543).

This is most often used for single, long running, administrative tasks, such as creating an HSNW index. Once the setting is implemented, you can view it by executing:

```sql
SHOW statement_timeout;
```

See the full guide on [changing session timeouts](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/21133).

### Function level

This works with the Database REST API when called from the Supabase client libraries:

```sql
create or replace function myfunc()
returns void as $$
 select pg_sleep(3); -- simulating some long-running process
$$
language sql
set statement_timeout TO '4s'; -- set custom timeout
```

This is mostly for recurring functions that need a special exemption for runtimes.

### Role level

This sets the timeout for a specific role.

The default role timeouts are:

- `anon`: 3s
- `authenticated`: 8s
- `service_role`: none (capped by API to be 60s)
- `postgres`: none (capped by default global timeout to be 2min)

Run the following query to change a role's timeout:

```sql
alter role example_role set statement_timeout = '10min'; -- could also use seconds '10s'
```

<Admonition type="tip">
  If you are changing the timeout for the Supabase Client API calls, you will need to reload
  postgREST to reflect the timeout changes by running the following script:

```sql
NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload config';
```

</Admonition>

Unlike global settings, the result cannot be checked with `SHOW
statement_timeout`. Instead, run:

```sql
select
  rolname,
  rolconfig
from pg_roles
where
  rolname in (
    'anon',
    'authenticated',
    'postgres',
    'service_role'
    -- ,<ANY CUSTOM ROLES>
  );
```

### Global level

This changes the statement timeout for all roles and sessions without an explicit timeout already set.

```sql
alter database postgres set statement_timeout TO '4s';
```

Check if your changes took effect:

```sql
show statement_timeout;
```

Although not necessary, if you are uncertain if a timeout has been applied, you can run a quick test:

```sql
create or replace function myfunc()
returns void as $$
  select pg_sleep(601); -- simulating some long-running process
$$
language sql;
```

## Identifying timeouts

The Supabase Dashboard contains tools to help you identify timed-out and long-running queries.

### Using the Log Explorer

Go to the [Log Explorer](/dashboard/project/_/logs/explorer), and run the following query to identify timed-out events (`statement timeout`) and queries that successfully run for longer than 10 seconds (`duration`).

```sql
select
  cast(postgres_logs.timestamp as datetime) as timestamp,
  event_message,
  parsed.error_severity,
  parsed.user_name,
  parsed.query,
  parsed.detail,
  parsed.hint,
  parsed.sql_state_code,
  parsed.backend_type
from
  postgres_logs
  cross join unnest(metadata) as metadata
  cross join unnest(metadata.parsed) as parsed
where
  regexp_contains(event_message, 'duration|statement timeout')
  -- (OPTIONAL) MODIFY OR REMOVE
  and parsed.user_name = 'authenticator' -- <--------CHANGE
order by timestamp desc
limit 100;
```

### Using the Query Performance page

Go to the [Query Performance page](/dashboard/project/_/advisors/query-performance?preset=slowest_execution) and filter by relevant role and query speeds. This only identifies slow-running but successful queries. Unlike the Log Explorer, it does not show you timed-out queries.

### Understanding roles in logs

Each API server uses a designated user for connecting to the database:

| Role                       | API/Tool                                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| supabase_admin             | Used by Supabase to configure projects and for monitoring                 |
| authenticator              | PostgREST                                                                 |
| supabase_auth_admin        | Auth                                                                      |
| supabase_storage_admin     | Storage                                                                   |
| supabase_realtime_admin    | Realtime                                                                  |
| supabase_replication_admin | Synchronizes Read Replicas                                                |
| postgres                   | Supabase Dashboard and External Tools (e.g., Prisma, SQLAlchemy, PSQL...) |
| Custom roles               | External Tools (e.g., Prisma, SQLAlchemy, PSQL...)                        |

Filter by the `parsed.user_name` field to only retrieve logs made by specific users:

```sql
-- find events based on role/server
... query
where
  -- find events from the relevant role
  parsed.user_name = '<ROLE>'
```
