In Postgres, an [event trigger](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/event-triggers.html) is very similar to a [trigger](/docs/guides/database/postgres/triggers), except that it is triggered by database level events (and is usually reserved for [superusers](/docs/guides/database/postgres/roles-superuser))

With our `Supautils` extension (installed automatically for all Supabase projects), the `postgres` user has the ability to create and manage event triggers.

Some use cases for event triggers ares:
- Capturing Data Definition Language (DDL) changes - these are changes to your database schema (though the [pgAudit](/docs/guides/database/extensions/pgaudit) extension provides a more complete solution)
- Monitoring/preventing actions - such as preventing tables from being dropped in Production or enforcing RLS on all new tables

In this guide, we will go through an example event trigger that prevents accidental dropping of a table

## Creating an event trigger

Event triggers can only be created by the `postgres` user so make sure you are authenticated as them. As with triggers, event triggers consist of 2 parts

1. A [Function](/docs/guides/database/functions) which will be executed
2. The actual Event Trigger object, with parameters around when the trigger should be run.

An example of a trigger is:

```sql
CREATE EVENT TRIGGER dont_drop_trigger
ON sql_drop
EXECUTE FUNCTION dont_drop_function();
```

## Trigger functions

A trigger function is a user-defined [Function](/docs/guides/database/functions) that Postgres executes when the trigger is fired.

### Example trigger function

This example protects any table from being dropped. It can be overridden by temporarily disabling the event trigger: `ALTER EVENT TRIGGER dont_drop_trigger DISABLE;`

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION dont_drop_function()
  RETURNS event_trigger LANGUAGE plpgsql AS $$
DECLARE
    obj record;
    tbl_name text;
BEGIN
    FOR obj IN SELECT * FROM pg_event_trigger_dropped_objects()
    LOOP
        IF obj.object_type = 'table' THEN
            RAISE EXCEPTION 'ERROR: All tables in this schema are protected and cannot be dropped';
        END IF;
    END LOOP;
END;
$$;

CREATE EVENT TRIGGER dont_drop_trigger
ON sql_drop
EXECUTE FUNCTION dont_drop_function();
```

### Event Trigger Functions and Firing Events

Event triggers can be triggered on:
- `ddl_command_start` - occurs just before a DDL command for almost all objects within a schema
- `ddl_command_end` - occurs just after a DDL command for almost all objects within a schema
- `sql_drop` - occurs just before `ddl_command_end` for any DDL commands that `DROP` a database object (note that altering a table can cause it to be dropped)
- `table_rewrite` - occurs just before a table is rewritten using the `ALTER TABLE` command

Within each event trigger, helper functions exist to view the objects being modified or the command being run. For example, our example calls `pg_event_trigger_dropped_objects()` to view the object(s) being dropped. For a more comprehensive overview of these functions, see the [official documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/event-trigger-definition.html)

To view the matrix commands that cause an event trigger to fire, see the [official documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/event-trigger-matrix.html)


## Disabling an event trigger

You can disable an event trigger using the `alter event trigger` command:

```sql
ALTER EVENT TRIGGER dont_drop_trigger DISABLE;
```

## Dropping an event trigger

You can delete a trigger using the `drop event trigger` command:

```sql
DROP EVENT TRIGGER dont_drop_trigger;
```
