[pg-safeupdate](https://github.com/eradman/pg-safeupdate) is a PostgreSQL extension designed to prevent users from accidentally updating or deleting too many records in a single statement by requiring a "where" clause in all update and delete statements.

The `pg-safeupdate` extension is a useful tool for protecting data integrity and preventing accidental data loss. Without it, a user could accidentally execute an update or delete statement that affects all records in a table. With `pg-safeupdate`, users are required to be more deliberate in their update and delete statements, which reduces the risk of significant error.

## Enable the extension

`pg-safeupdate` can be enabled on a per connection basis:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```sql
load 'safeupdate';
```

or for all connections:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```sql
alter database some_db set session_preload_libraries = 'safeupdate';
```

## Usage

Let's take a look at an example to see how pg-safeupdate works. Suppose we have a table called `employees` with the following columns: `id`, `name`, `department`, and `date_of_birth`. We want to update the `date_of_birth` for a specific employee with the `id` of 12345. Here is what the query would look like if we forgot to add a "where" clause:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```sql
load 'safeupdate';

update employees set date_of_birth = '1987-01-28';
```

This query updates the `date_of_birth` for all employees to 1987-01-28, which is not what we intended. With `pg-safeupdate` enabled, we receive an error message prompting us to add a "where" clause to the query:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```sql
ERROR: UPDATE requires a WHERE clause
```

We would then update our query to include a "where" clause specifying the employee with the `id` of 12345:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```sql
update employees set date_of_birth = '1987-01-28' where id = 12345;
```
