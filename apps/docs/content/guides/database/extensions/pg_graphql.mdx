[pg_graphql](https://supabase.github.io/pg_graphql/) is PostgreSQL extension for interacting with the database using [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) instead of SQL.

The extension reflects a GraphQL schema from the existing SQL schema and exposes it through a SQL function, `graphql.resolve(...)`. This enables any programming language that can connect to PostgreSQL to query the database via GraphQL with no additional servers, processes, or libraries.

The `pg_graphql` resolve method is designed to interop with [PostgREST](https://postgrest.org/en/stable/index.html), the tool that underpins the Supabase API, such that the `graphql.resolve` function can be called via RPC to safely and performantly expose the GraphQL API over HTTP/S.

For more information about how the SQL schema is reflected into a GraphQL schema, see the [pg_graphql API docs](https://supabase.github.io/pg_graphql/api/).

## Enable the extension

<Tabs
  scrollable
  size="small"
  type="underlined"
  defaultActiveId="dashboard"
  queryGroup="database-method"
>
<TabPanel id="dashboard" label="Dashboard">

1. Go to the [Database](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/database/tables) page in the Dashboard.
2. Click on **Extensions** in the sidebar.
3. Search for "pg_graphql" and enable the extension.

</TabPanel>
<TabPanel id="sql" label="SQL">

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```sql
-- Enable the "pg_graphql" extension
create extension pg_graphql;

-- Disable the "pg_graphql" extension
drop extension if exists pg_graphql;
```

Even though the SQL code is `create extension`, this is the equivalent of "enabling the extension".
To disable an extension you can call `drop extension`.

## Usage

Given a table

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```sql
create table "Blog"(
  id serial primary key,
  name text not null,
  description text,
);

insert into "Blog"(name)
values ('My Blog');
```

The reflected GraphQL schema can be queried immediately as

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```sql
select
  graphql.resolve($$
    {
      blogCollection(first: 1) {
        edges {
          node {
            id,
            name
          }
        }
      }
    }
  $$);
```

returning the JSON

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```json
{
  "data": {
    "blogCollection": {
      "edges": [
        {
          "node": {
            "id": 1
            "name": "My Blog"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Note that `pg_graphql` fully supports schema introspection so you can connect any GraphQL IDE or schema inspection tool to see the full set of fields and arguments available in the API.
