Replication is currently in private alpha. Access is limited and features may change.

## What destinations are supported?

Replication currently supports Iceberg (Analytics Buckets). See the [Destinations guide](/docs/guides/database/replication/replication-destinations) for details.

## Why is a table not being replicated?

Common reasons:

- **Missing primary key**: Tables must have a primary key to be replicated
- **Not in publication**: Ensure the table is included in your publication
- **Unsupported data types**: Tables with custom data types are not supported
- **Partitioned tables**: Not currently supported

Check your publication settings and verify your table meets the requirements.

## Why aren't publication changes reflected after adding or removing tables?

After modifying your publication, you must restart the pipeline for changes to take effect. See [Adding or removing tables](/docs/guides/database/replication/replication-setup#adding-or-removing-tables) for instructions.

## Why is a pipeline in failed state?

Pipeline failures occur during the streaming phase when an error happens while replicating live data. This prevents data loss. To recover:

1. Check the error message by hovering over the **Failed** status
2. Click **View status** for detailed information
3. Fix the underlying issue (e.g., schema mismatches, destination connectivity)
4. Restart the pipeline

See [Handling errors](/docs/guides/database/replication/replication-monitoring#handling-errors) for more details.

## Why is a table in error state?

Table errors occur during the copy phase. To recover, click **View status**, find the affected table, and reset the table state. This will restart the table copy from the beginning.

## How to verify replication is working

Check the [Database](/dashboard/project/_/database/replication) → **Replication** page:

1. Verify your pipeline shows **Running** status
2. Click **View status** to check table states
3. Ensure all tables show **Live** state (actively replicating)
4. Monitor replication lag metrics

See the [Replication Monitoring guide](/docs/guides/database/replication/replication-monitoring) for comprehensive monitoring instructions.

## What are the main limitations?

Key limitations to be aware of:

- **Primary keys**: Required on all tables
- **Custom data types**: Not supported
- **Schema changes**: Not automatically handled

Destination-specific limitations may also apply. See the [Iceberg](/docs/guides/database/replication/replication-iceberg#limitations) destination page for details.

## How to stop or pause replication

You can manage your pipeline using the actions menu in the destinations list. See [Managing your pipeline](/docs/guides/database/replication/replication-setup#managing-your-pipeline) for details on available actions.

Note: Stopping replication will cause changes to queue up in the WAL.

## Can data duplicates occur during pipeline operations?

Yes, data duplicates can occur in certain scenarios when stopping a pipeline.

When you stop a pipeline (for restarts or updates), replication tries to finish processing any transactions that are currently being sent to your destination. It waits up to a few minutes to allow these in-progress transactions to complete cleanly before stopping.

However, if a transaction in your database takes longer than this waiting period to complete, the pipeline will stop before that entire transaction has been fully processed. When the pipeline starts again, it must restart the incomplete transaction from the beginning to maintain transaction boundaries, which results in some data being sent twice to your destination.

**Understanding transaction boundaries**: A transaction is a group of database changes that happen together (for example, all changes within a `BEGIN...COMMIT` block). Replication must process entire transactions - it cannot process part of a transaction, stop, and then continue from the middle. This means if a transaction is interrupted, the whole transaction must be replayed when the pipeline resumes.

**Example scenario**: Suppose you have a batch operation that updates 10,000 rows within a single transaction. If this operation takes 10 minutes to complete and you stop the pipeline after 5 minutes (when 5,000 rows have been processed), the pipeline cannot resume from row 5,001. Instead, when it restarts, it must reprocess all 10,000 rows from the beginning, resulting in the first 5,000 rows being sent to your destination twice.

**Important**: We are not currently planning to implement automatic deduplication. If your use case requires guaranteed exactly-once delivery, you should implement deduplication logic in your downstream systems based on primary keys or other unique identifiers.

## Where to find replication logs

Navigate to [Logs](/dashboard/project/_/logs/explorer) → **Replication** to see all pipeline logs. Logs contain diagnostic information. If you're experiencing issues, contact support with your error details.
