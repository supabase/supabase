<Admonition type="caution" label="Private Alpha">

Replication is currently in private alpha. Access is limited and features may change.

Iceberg replication is currently incomplete. It provides an append-only log listing all your data changes with an additional column explaining the type of operation (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).

Apache Iceberg is an open table format for analytic datasets. Replication powered by [Supabase ETL](https://github.com/supabase/etl) to Iceberg uses Supabase [Analytics Buckets](/docs/guides/storage/analytics) to store your replicated data.

<Admonition type="tip">

This page covers Iceberg-specific configuration. For complete setup instructions including publications, general settings, and pipeline management, see the [Replication Setup guide](/docs/guides/database/replication/replication-setup).

### Setup

Setting up Iceberg replication requires two steps: creating an Analytics Bucket, then configuring it as a destination.

#### Step 1: Create an Analytics bucket

First, create an Analytics Bucket to store your replicated data:

1. Navigate to [Storage](/dashboard/project/_/storage/buckets) → **Analytics** in your Supabase Dashboard
2. Click **New bucket**

     src="/docs/img/database/replication/replication-iceberg-new-bucket.png"
     zoomable
   />

#### Step 2: Add Iceberg as a destination

After clicking **New bucket**, fill in the bucket details and copy the credentials:

1. Fill in the bucket details:

   <Image
     alt="Analytics Bucket Details"
     src="/docs/img/database/replication/replication-iceberg-details.png"
     zoomable
   />

   - **Name**: A unique name for your bucket
   - **Region**: Select the region where your data will be stored

2. Click **Create bucket**
3. **Copy the credentials** displayed after bucket creation (Catalog Token, S3 Access Key ID, S3 Secret Access Key). You'll need these in the next steps.
4. Navigate to [Database](/dashboard/project/_/database/replication) → **Replication** in your Supabase Dashboard
5. Click **Add destination**
6. Configure the destination:
   - **Destination type**: Select **Iceberg (Analytics Bucket)**
   - **Bucket**: The name of your Analytics Bucket from Step 1
   - **Namespace**: The schema name where your tables will be replicated (e.g., `public`)
   - **Catalog Token**: Authentication token for accessing the Iceberg catalog (copied in Step 3)
   - **S3 Access Key ID**: Access key for S3-compatible storage (copied in Step 3)
   - **S3 Secret Access Key**: Secret key for S3-compatible storage (copied in Step 3)
7. Complete the remaining configuration following the [Replication Setup guide](/docs/guides/database/replication/replication-setup)

For more information about Analytics Buckets, see the [Analytics Buckets documentation](/docs/guides/storage/analytics).

### Limitations

Iceberg-specific limitations:

- **Append-only log**: Currently provides an append-only log format rather than a full table representation

For general replication limitations that apply to all destinations, see the [Replication Setup guide](/docs/guides/database/replication/replication-setup#limitations).
