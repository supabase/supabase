ETL Replication requires two main components: a **publication** (source) and a **destination**.

## Step 1: Create a publication

A publication defines which tables and change types will be replicated. You need to create a publication before setting up a destination.

### Creating publications with SQL

You can create publications using SQL with different scopes:

#### Publication for a single table

To replicate changes from a single table:

```sql
-- Create a publication for a specific table
CREATE PUBLICATION my_publication FOR TABLE users;
```

This will track all changes (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) for the `users` table.

#### Publication for all tables in a schema

To replicate all tables in a specific schema:

```sql
-- Create a publication for all tables in the public schema
CREATE PUBLICATION my_publication FOR TABLES IN SCHEMA public;
```

This will track changes for all existing and future tables in the `public` schema.

#### Publication for all tables

To replicate all tables in your database:

```sql
-- Create a publication for all tables
CREATE PUBLICATION my_publication FOR ALL TABLES;
```

This will track changes for all tables in your database.

### Customizing change types

By default, publications track all operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE). You can customize this:

```sql
-- Only track inserts and updates
CREATE PUBLICATION my_publication FOR TABLE users
WITH (publish = 'insert,update');

-- Only track deletes
CREATE PUBLICATION my_publication FOR TABLE users
WITH (publish = 'delete');
```

### Adding tables to an existing publication

You can add more tables to an existing publication:

```sql
-- Add a table to an existing publication
ALTER PUBLICATION my_publication ADD TABLE posts;

-- Add multiple tables
ALTER PUBLICATION my_publication ADD TABLE comments, likes;
```

### Viewing publications in the Dashboard

After creating a publication via SQL, you can view it in the Supabase Dashboard:

1. Go to the [Database](/dashboard/project/_/database/tables) page in the Dashboard
2. Click on **Publications** in the sidebar
3. You'll see all your publications listed with their tables

You can also manage publications through the Dashboard by toggling **Source** for each table.

## Step 2: Add a destination

Once you have a publication, you can add a destination to start replicating data:

1. Navigate to the [Database](/dashboard/project/_/database/replication) section in your Supabase Dashboard
2. Select the **ETL Replication** tab
3. Click **Add destination** to open the New Destination panel
4. Configure the destination settings:
   - **Name**: Enter a descriptive name for your destination
   - **Publication**: Select the publication you created in Step 1
   - **Type**: Choose your destination type (BigQuery, Analytics Bucket, etc.)
   - Fill in the destination-specific configuration

5. Review the [Advanced Settings](#advanced-settings) if needed
6. Click **Create and start** to begin replication

## How it works

Once configured, ETL Replication will:

1. Capture changes from your database using the publication
2. Transform the data as needed
3. Load the data to your destination in near real-time

Changes are sent in batches to optimize performance and reduce costs.
