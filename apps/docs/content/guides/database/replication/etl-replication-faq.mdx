# What is ETL Replication?

ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Replication is Supabase's managed solution for automatically syncing your database to external destinations. Unlike manual replication where you configure third-party tools yourself, ETL Replication is fully managed by Supabase and configured through the Dashboard.

# How does ETL Replication differ from manual replication?

| Feature | ETL Replication | Manual Replication |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Setup** | Configured through Dashboard | Requires external tools and manual configuration |
| **Management** | Fully managed by Supabase | You manage the replication tools |
| **Destinations** | Specific supported destinations | Any destination that supports Postgres logical replication |
| **Monitoring** | Built-in Dashboard monitoring | Depends on your chosen tool |
| **Pricing** | Included with project | May incur costs from third-party tools |

# What destinations are currently supported?

ETL Replication currently supports:
- **BigQuery**: Google's data warehouse
- **Analytics Buckets**: Supabase Analytics storage

More destinations will be added in the future. For other destinations, use [Manual Replication](/docs/guides/database/replication/manual-replication-setup).

# Can I replicate specific tables or all tables?

Yes, you control what data is replicated by creating a [publication](/docs/guides/database/replication/etl-replication-setup#step-1-create-a-publication). You can create publications for:
- A single table
- All tables in a schema
- All tables in your database

# Can I filter which operations are replicated?

Yes, when creating a publication, you can specify which operations to replicate (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE). By default, all operations are replicated.

However, ETL Replication requires all event types to be enabled. You cannot filter specific operations for ETL destinations.

# What are the current limitations?

ETL Replication has several limitations:

- **TOASTed values**: Limited to 10MB (tables with TOAST columns should have replica identity set to full)
- **Custom data types**: Not supported
- **Event filtering**: No support for picking specific event types (all INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE events are required)
- **Column lists and row filters**: Not supported
- **Partitioned tables**: Not supported
- **Generated columns**: Not supported
- **Schema changes**: No support for altering schemas in the source
- **Primary keys**: Tables must have a primary key set

For more details, see the [ETL Replication limitations](/docs/guides/database/replication/etl-replication#limitations).

# How do I know if my replication is working?

You can monitor your replication status by:
1. Going to [Database](/dashboard/project/_/database/replication) → **ETL Replication**
2. Checking the status indicator on your destination
3. Clicking **View status** to see detailed information and logs

See the [Monitoring guide](/docs/guides/database/replication/etl-replication-monitoring) for more details.

# Why is my table not being replicated?

Common reasons include:
- The table is not included in your publication
- The table doesn't have a primary key
- The table contains unsupported data types
- The table is a partitioned table

Check your publication settings and the [limitations](#what-are-the-current-limitations) to ensure your table is supported.

# How long does it take for data to appear in the destination?

Data appears in near real-time, typically within seconds to a few minutes. However:
- Initial syncs for large tables may take longer
- Some destinations (like BigQuery) have ingestion latency
- Network conditions can affect replication speed

Monitor the replication lag in the [status view](/docs/guides/database/replication/etl-replication-monitoring#viewing-detailed-status-and-logs) to see the current delay.

# Can I pause or stop replication?

Yes, you can pause or delete a replication destination:
- To pause: Use the pause button in the ETL Replication dashboard
- To stop completely: Delete the destination from the dashboard

Note that pausing replication will cause data to queue up, which may consume WAL space on your database.

# What happens if replication fails?

If replication fails:
1. The status will change to **Error** in the dashboard
2. You'll see error details in the status view
3. Failed events will be retried automatically
4. You can view detailed error logs by clicking **View logs**

If errors persist, check the [troubleshooting guide](/docs/guides/database/replication/etl-replication-monitoring#troubleshooting).

# How do I change which tables are replicated?

To add or remove tables from replication:
1. Modify your publication using SQL (see [setup guide](/docs/guides/database/replication/etl-replication-setup#adding-tables-to-an-existing-publication))
2. Or create a new publication with the desired tables
3. Update your destination to use the new publication

# Can I use ETL Replication with Read Replicas?

ETL Replication and [Read Replicas](/docs/guides/platform/read-replicas) are different features:
- **ETL Replication**: Syncs data to external destinations for analytics and integration
- **Read Replicas**: Creates read-only Postgres databases in different regions for load balancing and latency reduction

You can use both features on the same project.

# Is ETL Replication available on all plans?

ETL Replication is currently in private alpha. To join the early access program, send an email to product-ops@supabase.io.
