# What destinations are supported?

ETL Replication currently supports Iceberg (Analytics Buckets). See the [ETL Destinations guide](/docs/guides/database/replication/etl-destinations) for details.

# Why is my table not being replicated?

Common reasons:
- **Missing primary key**: Tables must have a primary key to be replicated
- **Not in publication**: Ensure the table is included in your publication
- **Unsupported data types**: Tables with custom data types are not supported
- **Partitioned tables**: Not currently supported

Check your publication settings and verify your table meets the requirements.

# I added/removed tables from my publication. Why aren't changes reflected?

After modifying your publication, you must restart the ETL pipeline for changes to take effect. See [Adding or removing tables](/docs/guides/database/replication/etl-replication-setup#adding-or-removing-tables) for instructions.

# Why is my pipeline in Failed state?

Pipeline failures occur during the streaming phase when an error happens while replicating live data. This prevents data loss. To recover:

1. Check the error message by hovering over the **Failed** status
2. Click **View status** for detailed information
3. Fix the underlying issue (e.g., schema mismatches, destination connectivity)
4. Restart the pipeline

See [Handling errors](/docs/guides/database/replication/etl-replication-monitoring#handling-errors) for more details.

# Why is my table in Error state?

Table errors occur during the copy phase. To recover, click **View status**, find the affected table, and reset the table state. This will restart the table copy from the beginning.

# How do I know if replication is working?

Check the [Database](/dashboard/project/_/database/etl) → **ETL Replication** page:

1. Verify your pipeline shows **Running** status
2. Click **View status** to check table states
3. Ensure all tables show **Live** state (actively replicating)
4. Monitor replication lag metrics

See the [ETL Replication Monitoring guide](/docs/guides/database/replication/etl-replication-monitoring) for comprehensive monitoring instructions.

# What are the main limitations?

Key limitations to be aware of:

- **Primary keys**: Required on all tables
- **Custom data types**: Not supported
- **Schema changes**: Not automatically handled

Destination-specific limitations may also apply. See the [Iceberg](/docs/guides/database/replication/etl-iceberg#limitations) destination page for details.

# How do I stop or pause replication?

You can manage your pipeline using the actions menu in the destinations list. See [Managing your pipeline](/docs/guides/database/replication/etl-replication-setup#managing-your-pipeline) for details on available actions.

Note: Stopping replication will cause changes to queue up in the WAL.

# Where can I find replication logs?

Navigate to [Logs](/dashboard/project/_/logs/explorer) → **ETL Replication** to see all pipeline logs. Logs contain diagnostic information. If you're experiencing issues, contact support with your error details.

# How do I get help?

If you need assistance:

1. Check the [ETL Replication Setup guide](/docs/guides/database/replication/etl-replication-setup) and [ETL Replication Monitoring guide](/docs/guides/database/replication/etl-replication-monitoring)
2. Review this FAQ for common issues
3. Contact support with your error details and logs
