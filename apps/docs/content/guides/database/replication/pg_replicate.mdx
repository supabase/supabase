description: Replicate your Supabase database to external destinations
---

`pg_replicate` simplifies the process of syncing your data to an external destination. This could be another database, a data warehouse, or a specialized service such as customer management or business analytics software.

<Admonition type="caution">

`pg_replicate` is currently in alpha.

</Admonition>

Syncing requires a source and a destination. The source is your Supabase database. The destination is a third party. See the [supported destinations](#destinations).

## Sources

Choose what data to sync by creating a publication in your database. A publication is a set of changes, which can be filtered by table and change type.

### Managing publications

1. Go to the [Database](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/database/tables) page in the Dashboard.
2. Click on **Publications** in the sidebar.
3. Control which database events are sent by toggling **Insert**, **Update**, and **Delete**.
4. Control which tables broadcast changes by selecting **Source** and toggling each table.

## Destinations

Currently available destinations:

- [BigQuery](#bigquery)

### BigQuery

#### Prerequisites

Before setting up replication to BigQuery, you'll need:

1. A [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com/gcp) account
2. A [BigQuery dataset](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/datasets-intro) in your GCP project
3. A [GCP service account key](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete) in JSON format

#### Configuring BigQuery replication

1. Navigate to the Database section in your Supabase Dashboard and select the **Replication** tab.
2. Click **Add destination** to open the New Destination panel.
3. Click **Enable replication**.
4. Configure your replication settings:
   - **Name**: Enter a descriptive name for your replication destination
   - **Publication**: Select an existing publication or create a new one
   - **Type**: Select "BigQuery" from the destination types
   - **Project Id**: Enter your GCP project ID
   - **Project's Dataset Id**: Enter the ID of your BigQuery dataset
   - **Service Account Key**: Enter your GCP service account key
5. Review the [Advanced Settings](#advanced-settings) if you need to customize the replication behavior.
6. Click **Create** to start the replication process.

#### Advanced settings

- **Max size**: Changes are sent in batches. Max size limits the size of an individual batch.
- **Max fill seconds**: Number of seconds after which a batch should be sent, even if it hasn't reached the max size.
- **Max staleness**: See BigQuery's [`max_staleness`](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/change-data-capture#manage_table_staleness) option

## Monitoring replication

After setting up replication, data will begin flowing within a few minutes. You can monitor the replication status and review any errors directly from the [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/database/replication).

## Limitations

- Large values stored as [TOASTed values](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/storage-toast.html) are not replicated.
- Custom data types are not supported.
