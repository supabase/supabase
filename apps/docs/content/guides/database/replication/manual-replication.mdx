title: Manual Replication
subtitle: Set up your own replication pipeline for more control
---

Postgres comes with built-in support for replication. If `pg_replicate` doesn't provide a destination that you need, or if you need more control over the replication process, you can set up your own replication pipeline using Postgres primitives.

## Replication and publications

Replication is done through _publications_. A [publication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication-publication.html) is a set of changes. You can choose which tables and change events to include in a publication.

Once a publication is created, it can be listened to by a subscriber. Subscriptions are handled using Postgres [replication slots](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication-subscription.html). The exact connection parameters for the replication slot depend on your downstream subscriber. See your subscriber documentation for more details.

## Managing publications in the dashboard

1. Go to the [Database](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/database/tables) page in the Dashboard.
2. Click on **Publications** in the sidebar.
3. Control which database events are sent by toggling **Insert**, **Update**, and **Delete**.
4. Control which tables broadcast changes by selecting **Source** and toggling each table.

## Managing publications using SQL

### Create a publication

Create a publication that includes changes to all tables:

```sql
create publication publication_name
for all tables;
```

### Create a publication to listen to individual tables

```sql
create publication publication_name
for table table_one, table_two;
```

### Add tables to an existing publication

```sql
alter publication publication_name
add table table_name;
```

### Create a publication that only listens to `insert` events

```sql
create publication publication_name
for all tables
with (publish = 'insert');
```

### Create a publication that only listens to `update` events

```sql
create publication publication_name
for all tables
with (publish = 'update');
```

### Create a publication that only listens to `delete` events

```sql
create publication publication_name
for all tables
with (publish = 'delete');
```

### Remove a publication

```sql
drop publication if exists publication_name;
```

### Recreate a publication

Recreate a publication in a transaction to make sure the operation succeeds:

```sql
begin;
  -- remove the realtime publication
  drop publication if exists publication_name;

  -- re-create the publication but don't enable it for any tables
  create publication publication_name;
commit;
```
