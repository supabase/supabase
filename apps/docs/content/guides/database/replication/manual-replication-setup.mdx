This guide covers setting up **manual logical replication** using external tools. If you prefer a simpler, managed solution, read [the Replication setup docs](/docs/guides/database/replication/replication-setup) instead.

<Admonition type="note">

This guide is for replicating data to external systems using your own tools. For deploying read-only databases across multiple regions, see [Read Replicas](/docs/guides/platform/read-replicas) instead.

</Admonition>

### Prerequisites

To set up replication, the following is recommended:

- Instance size of XL or greater
- [IPv4 add-on](/docs/guides/platform/ipv4-address) enabled

To create a replication slot, you will need to use the `postgres` user and follow the instructions in the [external replication setup guide](/docs/guides/database/postgres/setup-replication-external).

<Admonition type="note">

If you are running Postgres 17 or higher, you can create a new user and grant them replication permissions with the `postgres` user. For versions below 17, you will need to use the `postgres` user.

</Admonition>

If you are replicating to an external system and using any of the tools below, check their documentation first. Additional information is provided where the setup with Supabase can vary.

You can change the settings of your Supabase project to support high volume replication, read the [customising Postgres config guide](/docs/guides/platform/custom-postgres-config) for more information on the settings available.

<TabPanel id="airbyte" label="Airbyte">

Airbyte has the following [documentation](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/sources/postgres/) for setting up Postgres as a source, either in their cloud offering or by self-hosting.

You can follow those steps with the following modifications:

1. Use the `postgres` user
2. Select `logical replication` as the replication method (`xmin` is possible, but not recommended)

### Troubleshooting

Airbyte has a known [issue](https://discuss.airbyte.io/t/postgres-source-replication-slot-safe-wal-size-only-reset-when-a-change-occurs/3263/7) where it does not clear WAL files on each successful sync. The recommended workaround is to have a `heartbeat` table that you write changes to once an hour.>

<TabPanel id="estuary" label="Estuary">
Estuary has the following [documentation](https://docs.estuary.dev/reference/Connectors/capture-connectors/PostgreSQL/Supabase/) for setting up Postgres as a source.

</TabPanel>

<TabPanel id="fivetran" label="Fivetran">

Fivetran has the following [documentation](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql/setup-guide) for setting up Postgres as a source.

You can follow those steps with the following modifications:

1. In Step 2, choose `logical replication` as the sync mechanism
2. In Step 3, do not create a user and use the existing `postgres` user for replication
3. In Step 5, no need to modify any WAL settings as this has been configured

<TabPanel id="materialize" label="Materialize">

Materialize has the following [documentation](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/create-source/postgres/) on setting up Postgres as a source.

You can follow those steps with the following modifications:

1. Follow the steps in the [external replication setup guide](/docs/guides/database/postgres/setup-replication-external) to create a publication slot

<TabPanel id="stitch" label="Stitch">

Stitch has the following [documentation](https://www.stitchdata.com/docs/integrations/databases/postgresql/v2#extract-data) on configuring Postgres as a source.

You can follow those steps with the following modifications:

1. Use the `postgres` user for replication
2. Skip step 3

<TabPanel id="dms" label="AWS DMS">

AWS DMS has the following [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/Welcome.html) on configuring Postgres as a source.

DMS is notably useful if you have infrastructure running in AWS and/or you have custom networking. An additional benefit is that DMS is able to replicate schema changes.

You can follow those steps with the following modifications:

1. Use the `postgres` user for replication (or create a new user with replication permissions: `ALTER USER <user> WITH REPLICATION;`)
2. Set `pluginname` to `test-decoding`
3. Depending on your databases the pre-assessment may fail. It is not required.
4. Increase `wal_sender_timeout` and other settings (`max_wal_size`) using the [Supabase CLI](/docs/guides/platform/custom-postgres-config)
