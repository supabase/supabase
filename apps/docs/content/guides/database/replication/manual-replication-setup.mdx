Manual destinations let you configure your own replication using external tools and **Postgres logical replication**. This gives you full control over the replication process and allows you to replicate to any system that supports Postgres logical replication.

This guide covers setting up **manual destinations** using external tools. If you prefer a simpler, managed solution, see [Managed destinations](/docs/guides/database/replication/etl-replication-setup) instead.

<Admonition type="note">

This guide is for replicating data to external systems using your own tools. For deploying read-only databases across multiple regions, see [Read Replicas](/docs/guides/platform/read-replicas) instead.

</Admonition>

## Prerequisites

Before setting up manual replication, ensure you have:

- **Instance size**: XL or greater (recommended for replication workloads)
- **IPv4 add-on**: [Enabled](/docs/guides/platform/ipv4-address) if your external tool doesn't support IPv6
- **Database access**: You'll need the `postgres` user credentials

<Admonition type="note">

If you are running Postgres 17 or higher, you can create a new user and grant them replication permissions with the `postgres` user. For versions below 17, you will need to use the `postgres` user.

</Admonition>

## Configure your replication tool

To create a replication slot, you will need to use the `postgres` user and follow the instructions in our [Setup Replication External guide](/docs/guides/database/postgres/setup-replication-external).

If you are replicating to an external system and using any of the tools below, check their documentation first. We have added Supabase-specific information where the setup can vary.

<TabPanel id="airbyte" label="Airbyte">

Airbyte provides [documentation](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/sources/postgres/) for setting up Postgres as a source, available in both cloud and self-hosted versions.

**Supabase-specific modifications:**

1. Use the `postgres` user for authentication
2. Select **logical replication** as the replication method (not `xmin`)

<Admonition type="caution">

Airbyte has a known [issue](https://discuss.airbyte.io/t/postgres-source-replication-slot-safe-wal-size-only-reset-when-a-change-occurs/3263/7) where it doesn't clear WAL files on each successful sync. The recommended workaround is to create a `heartbeat` table and write changes to it once an hour.

<TabPanel id="estuary" label="Estuary">

Estuary provides [Supabase-specific documentation](https://docs.estuary.dev/reference/Connectors/capture-connectors/PostgreSQL/Supabase/) for setting up Postgres replication.

Follow their guide - it includes all the necessary Supabase configurations.

</TabPanel>

<TabPanel id="fivetran" label="Fivetran">

Fivetran provides [documentation](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/databases/postgresql/setup-guide) for setting up Postgres as a source.

**Supabase-specific modifications:**

1. **Step 2**: Choose **logical replication** as the sync mechanism
2. **Step 3**: Use the existing `postgres` user (don't create a new user)
3. **Step 5**: Skip WAL settings modification (already configured for you)

</TabPanel>

<TabPanel id="materialize" label="Materialize">

Materialize provides [documentation](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/create-source/postgres/) for setting up Postgres as a source.

**Supabase-specific modifications:**

1. Follow our [Setup Replication External guide](/docs/guides/database/postgres/setup-replication-external) to create the publication and replication slot

</TabPanel>

<TabPanel id="stitch" label="Stitch">

Stitch provides [documentation](https://www.stitchdata.com/docs/integrations/databases/postgresql/v2#extract-data) for configuring Postgres as a source.

**Supabase-specific modifications:**

1. Use the `postgres` user for authentication
2. **Step 3**: Skip this step (WAL settings already configured)
