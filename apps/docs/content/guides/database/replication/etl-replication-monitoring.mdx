After setting up ETL replication, you can monitor the status and health of your replication pipelines directly from the Supabase Dashboard.

## Viewing replication status

To monitor your ETL replication:

1. Navigate to the [Database](/dashboard/project/_/database/replication) section in your Supabase Dashboard
2. Select the **ETL Replication** tab
3. You'll see a list of all your active destinations with their current status

Each destination shows:
- **Name**: The name you gave to the destination
- **Type**: The destination type (BigQuery, Analytics Bucket, etc.)
- **Status**: Current replication state (Active, Error, Paused, etc.)
- **Publication**: The source publication being replicated

## Viewing detailed status and logs

For more detailed information about a specific replication pipeline:

1. Navigate to [Database](/dashboard/project/_/database/replication) → **ETL Replication**
2. Find the destination you want to monitor
3. Click the **View status** button for that destination

In the status view, you can:

- **View real-time status**: See the current state of your replication pipeline
- **Check replication lag**: Monitor how up-to-date your destination is
- **View error details**: See any errors that occurred during replication
- **Access logs**: Click the **View logs** button to see detailed replication logs

## Understanding replication states

Your ETL replication destination can be in one of several states:

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Active** | Replication is running normally |
| **Initializing** | Initial setup is in progress |
| **Syncing** | Performing initial data sync |
| **Error** | An error occurred during replication |
| **Paused** | Replication has been manually paused |

## Monitoring replication lag

Replication lag indicates how far behind the destination is from the source database. In the status view, you can see:

- **Last sync time**: When the destination last received changes
- **Records pending**: Number of changes waiting to be replicated
- **Lag time**: Time delay between source and destination

Due to ingestion latency in some destinations (like BigQuery), there may be a natural delay in the data flow. This is normal and expected.

## Common monitoring scenarios

### Checking if replication is healthy

1. Navigate to [Database](/dashboard/project/_/database/replication) → **ETL Replication**
2. Check that your destination shows **Active** status
3. Click **View status** to verify data is flowing

### Investigating errors

If you see an **Error** status:

1. Click **View status** on the affected destination
2. Review the error message displayed
3. Click **View logs** to see detailed error information
4. Check the [FAQ](/docs/guides/database/replication/etl-replication-faq) for common issues

### Monitoring performance

To ensure optimal performance:

1. Check replication lag regularly
2. Monitor the number of pending records
3. Review logs for any warnings or performance issues
4. Adjust [Advanced Settings](/docs/guides/database/replication/etl-replication#advanced-settings) if needed

## Troubleshooting

If you notice issues with your ETL replication:

1. **Check the publication**: Ensure your publication is properly configured and includes the tables you want to replicate
2. **Verify credentials**: Confirm that destination credentials are still valid
3. **Review error logs**: Use the **View logs** button to identify specific errors
4. **Check destination capacity**: Ensure your destination can handle the data volume
5. **Monitor database load**: High load on the source database can affect replication

For more troubleshooting tips, see the [ETL Replication FAQ](/docs/guides/database/replication/etl-replication-faq).
