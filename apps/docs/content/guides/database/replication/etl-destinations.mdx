<Admonition type="caution" label="Private Alpha">

Automatic destinations are currently in private alpha. Access is limited and features may change.

</Admonition>

Automatic destinations support multiple destination types for syncing your database using Supabase ETL. Choose the destination that best fits your analytics and integration needs.

<Admonition type="note">

Some destinations may not be available for all users. Additional destinations are planned for the future, but we don't have public timelines to share at this time.
