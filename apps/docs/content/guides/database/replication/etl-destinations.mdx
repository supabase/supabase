<Admonition type="caution" label="Private Alpha">

Managed destinations are currently in private alpha. Access is limited and features may change.

Managed destinations support multiple destination types for syncing your database using Supabase ETL. Choose the destination that best fits your analytics and integration needs.

<Admonition type="note">

Some destinations may not be available for all users. Additional destinations are planned for the future, but we don't have public timelines to share at this time.
