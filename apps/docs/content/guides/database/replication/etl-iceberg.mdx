Managed destinations are currently in private alpha. Access is limited and features may change.

Iceberg replication is currently incomplete. It provides an append-only log listing all your data changes with an additional column explaining the type of operation (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).

</Admonition>

Apache Iceberg is an open table format for analytic datasets. Replication to Iceberg uses Supabase [Analytics Buckets](/docs/guides/storage/analytics) to store your replicated data.

This page covers Iceberg-specific configuration. For complete setup instructions including publications, general settings, and pipeline management, see the [Managed Destinations Setup guide](/docs/guides/database/replication/etl-replication-setup).

### Setup

Setting up Iceberg replication requires two steps: creating an Analytics Bucket, then configuring it as a replication destination.

#### Step 1: Create an Analytics bucket

First, create an Analytics Bucket to store your replicated data:

1. Navigate to [Storage](/dashboard/project/_/storage/buckets) → **Analytics** in your Supabase Dashboard
2. Click **New bucket**

     src="/docs/img/database/replication/etl-iceberg-new-bucket.png"
     zoomable
   />

#### Step 2: Add Iceberg as a replication destination

After clicking **New bucket**, fill in the bucket details and copy the credentials:

1. Fill in the bucket details:

   <Image
     alt="Analytics Bucket Details"
     src="/docs/img/database/replication/etl-iceberg-details.png"
     zoomable
   />

   - **Name**: A unique name for your bucket
   - **Region**: Select the region where your data will be stored

2. Click **Create bucket**
3. **Copy the credentials** displayed after bucket creation (Catalog Token, S3 Access Key ID, S3 Secret Access Key). You'll need these in the next steps.
4. Navigate to [Database](/dashboard/project/_/database/etl) → **ETL Replication** in your Supabase Dashboard
5. Click **Add destination**
6. Configure the destination:
   - **Destination type**: Select **Iceberg (Analytics Bucket)**
   - **Bucket**: The name of your Analytics Bucket from Step 1
   - **Namespace**: The schema name where your tables will be replicated (e.g., `public`)
   - **Catalog Token**: Authentication token for accessing the Iceberg catalog (copied in Step 3)
   - **S3 Access Key ID**: Access key for S3-compatible storage (copied in Step 3)
   - **S3 Secret Access Key**: Secret key for S3-compatible storage (copied in Step 3)
7. Complete the remaining configuration following the [Managed Destinations Setup guide](/docs/guides/database/replication/etl-replication-setup)

For more information about Analytics Buckets, see the [Analytics Buckets documentation](/docs/guides/storage/analytics).

### Limitations

Iceberg-specific limitations:

- **Append-only log**: Currently provides an append-only log format rather than a full table representation

For general replication limitations that apply to all managed destinations, see the [Managed Destinations Setup guide](/docs/guides/database/replication/etl-replication-setup#limitations).
