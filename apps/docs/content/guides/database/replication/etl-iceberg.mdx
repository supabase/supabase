Apache Iceberg is an open table format for analytic datasets. ETL Replication to Iceberg uses Supabase [Analytics Buckets](/docs/guides/storage/analytics) to store your replicated data.

To set up ETL Replication, follow the [ETL Replication Setup guide](/docs/guides/database/replication/etl-replication-setup).

<Admonition type="caution" label="Current Limitation">

Iceberg replication is currently incomplete. It provides an append-only log listing all your data changes with an additional column explaining the type of operation (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).

## Creating an Analytics Bucket

Before configuring Iceberg as a destination, you need to create an Analytics Bucket:

1. Navigate to [Storage](/dashboard/project/_/storage/buckets) → **Analytics** in your Supabase Dashboard
2. Click **New bucket**

   <Image
     alt="Create New Analytics Bucket"
     src="/docs/img/database/replication/etl-iceberg-new-bucket.png"
     zoomable
   />

3. Fill in the bucket details:

   <Image
     alt="Analytics Bucket Details"
     src="/docs/img/database/replication/etl-iceberg-details.png"
     zoomable
   />

   - **Name**: A unique name for your bucket
   - **Region**: Select the region where your data will be stored

4. Click **Create bucket**

## Iceberg-specific settings

When adding Iceberg (Analytics Bucket) as a destination in the ETL Replication setup, the configuration will automatically use your Analytics Bucket. No additional Iceberg-specific settings are required beyond selecting your bucket.

For more information about Analytics Buckets, see the [Analytics Buckets documentation](/docs/guides/storage/analytics).

## Limitations

Iceberg-specific limitations:

- **Append-only log**: Currently provides an append-only log format rather than a full table representation

For general ETL Replication limitations that apply to all destinations, see the [ETL Replication Setup guide](/docs/guides/database/replication/etl-replication-setup#limitations).
