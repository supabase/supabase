[`psql`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html) is a command-line tool that comes with Postgres.

## Connecting with SSL

You should connect to your database using SSL wherever possible, to prevent snooping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

You can obtain your connection info and Server root certificate from your application's dashboard:

![Connection Info and Certificate.](/docs/img/database/database-settings-ssl.png)

Download your [SSL certificate](#connecting-with-ssl) to `/path/to/prod-supabase.cer`.

Find your connection settings. Go to your [`Database Settings`](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/database/settings) and make sure `Use connection pooling` is checked. Change the connection mode to `Session`, and copy the parameters into the connection string:

```shell
psql "sslmode=verify-full sslrootcert=/path/to/prod-supabase.cer host=[CLOUD_PROVIDER]-0-[REGION].pooler.supabase.com dbname=postgres user=postgres.[PROJECT_REF]"
```
