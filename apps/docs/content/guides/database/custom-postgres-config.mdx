Each Supabase project is a pre-configured Postgres cluster. You can override some configuration settings to suit your needs. This is an advanced topic, and we don't recommend touching these settings unless it is necessary.

<Admonition type="note">

Customizing Postgres configurations provides _advanced_ control over your database, but inappropriate settings can lead to severe performance degradation or project instability.

</Admonition>

### Viewing settings

To list all Postgres settings and their descriptions, run:

```sql
select * from pg_settings;
```

## Configurable settings

### User-context settings

The [`pg_settings`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/view-pg-settings.html) table's `context` column specifies the requirements for changing a setting. By default, those with a `user` context can be changed at the `role` or `database` level with [SQL](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/sql/).

To list all user-context settings, run:

```sql
select * from pg_settings where context = 'user';
```

As an example, the `statement_timeout` setting can be altered:

```sql
alter database "postgres" set "statement_timeout" TO '60s';
```

To verify the change, execute:

```sql
show "statement_timeout";
```

### Superuser settings

Some settings can only be modified by a superuser. Supabase pre-enables the [`supautils` extension](https://supabase.com/blog/roles-postgres-hooks#setting-up-the-supautils-extension), which allows the `postgres` role to retain certain superuser privileges. It enables modification of the below reserved configurations at the `role` level:

For example, to enable `log_nested_statements` for the `postgres` role, execute:

```sql
alter role "postgres" set "auto_explain.log_nested_statements" to 'on';
```

To view the change:

```sql
select
  rolname,
  rolconfig
from pg_roles
where rolname = 'postgres';
```

### CLI configurable settings

While many Postgres parameters are configurable directly, some configurations can be changed with the Supabase CLI at the [`system`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/config-setting.html#CONFIG-SETTING-SQL) level.

<Admonition type="caution">

CLI changes permanently overwrite default settings, so `reset all` and `set to default` commands won't revert to the original values.

</Admonition>

<Admonition type="danger">

In order to overwrite the default settings, you must have `Owner` or `Administrator` privileges within your organizations.

</Admonition>

#### CLI supported parameters

<Admonition type="tip">

If a setting you need is not yet configurable, [share your use case with us](https://supabase.com/dashboard/support/new)! Let us know what setting you'd like to control, and we'll consider adding support in future updates.

#### Managing Postgres configuration with the CLI

To start:

1. [Install](/docs/guides/resources/supabase-cli) Supabase CLI 1.69.0+.
1. [Log in](/docs/guides/cli/local-development#log-in-to-the-supabase-cli) to your Supabase account using the CLI.

To update Postgres configurations, use the [`postgres config`](/docs/reference/cli/supabase-postgres-config) command:

```bash
supabase --experimental \
--project-ref <project-ref> \
postgres-config update --config shared_buffers=250MB
```

By default, the CLI will merge any provided config overrides with any existing ones. The `--replace-existing-overrides` flag can be used to instead force all existing overrides to be replaced with the ones being provided:

```bash
supabase --experimental \
--project-ref <project-ref> \
postgres-config update --config max_parallel_workers=3 \
--replace-existing-overrides
```

To delete specific configuration overrides, use the `postgres-config delete` command:

```bash
supabase --experimental \
--project-ref <project-ref> \
postgres-config delete --config shared_buffers,work_mem
```

By default, changing the configuration, whether by updating or deleting, causes the database and all associated read replicas to restart. You can use the `--no-restart` flag to prevent this behavior, and attempt to reload the updated configuration without a restart. Refer to the Postgres documentation to determine if a given parameter can be reloaded without a restart.

<Admonition type="note" label="Read Replicas and Custom Config">

Postgres requires several parameters to be synchronized between the Primary cluster and [Read Replicas](/docs/guides/platform/read-replicas).

By default, Supabase ensures that this propagation is executed correctly. However, if the `--no-restart` behavior is used in conjunction with parameters that cannot be reloaded without a restart, the user is responsible for ensuring that both the primaries and the read replicas get restarted in a timely manner to ensure a stable running state. Leaving the configuration updated, but not utilized (via a restart) in such a case can result in read replica failure if the primary, or a read replica, restarts in isolation (e.g. due to an out-of-memory event, or hardware failure).

</Admonition>

```bash
supabase --experimental \
--project-ref <project-ref> \
postgres-config delete --config shared_buffers --no-restart
```

### Resetting to default config

To reset a setting to its default value at the database level:

```sql
-- reset a single setting at the database level
alter database "postgres" set "<setting_name>" to default;

-- reset all settings at the database level
alter database "postgres" reset all;
```

For `role` level configurations, you can run:

```sql
alter role "<role_name>" set "<setting_name>" to default;
```

### Considerations

1. Changes through the CLI might restart the database causing momentary disruption to existing database connections; in most cases this should not take more than a few seconds. However, you can use the --no-restart flag to bypass the restart and keep the connections intact. Keep in mind that this depends on the specific configuration changes you're making. if the change requires a restart, using the --no-restart flag will prevent the restart but you won't see those changes take effect until a restart is manually triggered. Additionally, some parameters are required to be the same on Primary and Read Replicas; not restarting in these cases can result in read replica failure if the Primary/Read Replicas restart in isolation.
1. Custom Postgres Config will always override the default optimizations generated by Supabase. When changing compute add-ons, you should also review and update your custom Postgres Config to ensure they remain compatible and effective with the updated compute.
1. Some parameters (e.g. `wal_keep_size`) can increase disk utilization, triggering disk expansion, which in turn can lead to [increases in your bill](/docs/guides/platform/compute-add-ons#disk-io).
