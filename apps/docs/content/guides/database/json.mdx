Postgres supports storing and querying unstructured data.

## JSON vs JSONB

Postgres supports two types of JSON columns: `json` (stored as a string) and `jsonb` (stored as a binary). The recommended type is `jsonb` for almost all cases.

- `json` stores an exact copy of the input text. Database functions must reparse the content on each execution.
- `jsonb` stores database in a decomposed binary format. While this makes it slightly slower to input due to added conversion overhead, it is significantly faster to process, since no reparsing is needed.

## When to use JSON/JSONB

Generally you should use a `jsonb` column when you have data that is unstructured or has a variable schema. For example, if you wanted to store responses for various webhooks, you might not know the format of the response when creating the table. Instead, you could store the `payload` as a `jsonb` object in a single column.

Don't go overboard with `json/jsonb` columns. They are a useful tool, but most of the benefits of a relational database come from the ability to query and join structured data, and the referential integrity that brings.

## Create JSONB columns

`json/jsonb` is just another "data type" for Postgres columns. You can create a `jsonb` column in the same way you would create a `text` or `int` column:

1. Go to the [Table Editor](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/editor) page in the Dashboard.
2. Click **New Table** and create a table called `books`.
3. Include a primary key with the following properties and click save:

- Name: `id`
  - Type: `int8`
  - Default value: `Automatically generate as indentity`
- **title** column
  - Name: `title`
  - Type: `text`
- **author** column
  - Name: `author`
  - Type: `text`
- **metadata** column
  - Name: `metadata`
  - Type: `jsonb`

## Inserting JSON data

You can insert JSON data in the same way that you insert any other data. The data must be valid JSON.

## Query JSON data

Querying JSON data is similar to querying other data, with a few other features to access nested values.

Postgres support a range of [JSON functions and operators](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html). For example, the `->` operator returns values as `jsonb` data. If you want the data returned as `text`, use the `->>` operator.

## Validating JSON data

Supabase provides the [`pg_jsonschema` extension](/docs/guides/database/extensions/pg_jsonschema) that adds the ability to validate `json` and `jsonb` data types against [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) documents.

Once you have enabled the extension, you can add a "check constraint" to your table to validate the JSON data:

```sql
create table customers (
  id serial primary key,
  metadata json
);

alter table customers
add constraint check_metadata check (
  json_matches_schema(
    '{
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "tags": {
                "type": "array",
                "items": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "maxLength": 16
                }
            }
        }
    }',
    metadata
  )
);
```
