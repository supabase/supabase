Supabase's auto-generated Data APIs let you perform operations on your database using REST API calls. You can read, write, and delete data, and even call functions, without writing an intermediate layer to translate between your app and Postgres.

## How to use the data APIs

The Data APIs are auto-generated HTTP REST endpoints. You can call them in the same way as any HTTP endpoint, for example, using `curl` from the command line or `fetch` from the browser. For convenience, you can use the Supabase client libraries. The client libraries perform the HTTP call for you, while also handling authentication, parsing responses, and maintaining type safety.
