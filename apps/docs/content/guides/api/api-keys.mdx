Supabase provides 2 default keys when you create a project: a <LegacyApiKeys keyword='publishable' type='anon'/> key, and a <LegacyApiKeys keyword='secret' type='secret'/> key. You can find both keys in the [API Settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/*/settings/api).

The data APIs are designed to work with Postgres Row Level Security (RLS). These keys map to the following Postgres roles:

| Key           | Postgres Role  |
| ------------- | -------------- |
| `publishable` | `anon`         |
| `secret`      | `service_role` |

You can find an `anon` user and a `service_role` user in the [Roles](http://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/database/roles) section of the dashboard.

## Publishable key

The `publishable` key maps to the `anon` Postgres role, which has very few privileges. You can use it in your [RLS policies](/docs/guides/database/postgres/row-level-security) to allow unauthenticated access. For example, this policy will allow unauthenticated access to the `profiles` table:

```sql
create policy "Allow public access" on profiles to anon for
select
  using (true);
```

And similarly for disallowing access:

```sql
create policy "Disallow public access" on profiles to anon for
select
  using (false);
```

If you are using [Supabase Auth](/docs/guides/auth/overview), then the `anon` role will automatically update to `authenticated` once a user is logged in:

```sql
create policy "Allow access to authenticated users" on profiles to authenticated for
select
  using (true);
```

## Secret key

The `secret` key maps to the `service_role` Postgres role, which is a predefined Postgres role with elevated privileges, designed to perform various administrative and service-related tasks. It can bypass Row Level Security, so it should only be used on a private server.

<Admonition type="caution">

Never expose the `secret` key in a browser or anywhere where a user can see it.

A common use case for the `secret` key is running data analytics jobs on the backend. To support joins on user id, it is often useful to grant the service role read access to `auth.users` table.

```sql
grant
select
  on table auth.users to service_role;
```

## Legacy API Keys

<Admonition type="warning" label="Legacy API keys">

The `anon` and `service_role` keys are being deprecated on 1st May 2025 for new and restored projects. For existing projects, these keys will be deprecated on 1st October 2025. For more information, read the [announcement](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/29260).

You can find the `anon` and `service_role` keys in the [API Settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/api).

The data APIs are designed to work with Postgres Row Level Security (RLS). These keys both map to Postgres roles. You can find an `anon` user and a `service_role` user in the [Roles](http://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/database/roles) section of the dashboard.

The keys are both long-lived JWTs. If you decode these keys, you will see that they contain the "role", an "issued date", and an "expiry date" ~10 years in the future.

```json
{
  "role": "anon",
  "iat": 1625137684,
  "exp": 1940713684
}
```

We have [partnered with GitHub](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-03-28-supabase-is-now-a-github-secret-scanning-partner/) to scan for Supabase `service_role` keys pushed to public repositories.
If they detect any keys with service_role privileges being pushed to GitHub, they will forward the API key to us, so that we can automatically revoke the detected secrets and notify you, protecting your data against malicious actors.
