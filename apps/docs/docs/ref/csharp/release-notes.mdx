## 0.11.0 - 2023-05-24

- Update dependency: postgrest-csharp@3.2.0
  - General codebase and QOL improvements. Exceptions are generally thrown through `PostgrestException` now instead
    of `Exception`. A `FailureHint.Reason` is provided with failures if possible to parse.
  - `AddDebugListener` is now available on the client to help with debugging
  - Merges [#65](https://github.com/supabase-community/postgrest-csharp/pull/65) Cleanup + Add better exception handling
  - Merges [#66](https://github.com/supabase-community/postgrest-csharp/pull/66) Local test Fixes
  - Fixes [#67](https://github.com/supabase-community/postgrest-csharp/issues/67) Postgrest Reference attribute is
    producing StackOverflow for circular references
- Update dependency: gotrue-csharp@4.0.2
  - [#58](https://github.com/supabase-community/gotrue-csharp/issues/58) - Add support for the `reauthentication` endpoint which allows for secure password changes.
- Update dependency: realtime-csharp@6.0.1
  - Updates publishing action for future packages, includes README and icon.
  - Merges [#28](https://github.com/supabase-community/realtime-csharp/pull/28) and [#30](https://github.com/supabase-community/realtime-csharp/pull/30)
  - The realtime client now takes a "fail-fast" approach. On establishing an initial connection, client will throw
    a `RealtimeException` in `ConnectAsync()` if the socket server is unreachable. After an initial connection has been
    established, the **client will continue attempting reconnections indefinitely until disconnected.**
  - [Major, New] C# `EventHandlers` have been changed to `delegates`. This should allow for cleaner event data access over
    the previous subclassed `EventArgs` setup. Events are scoped accordingly. For example, the `RealtimeSocket` error
    handlers will receive events regarding socket connectivity; whereas the `RealtimeChannel` error handlers will receive
    events according to `Channel` joining/leaving/etc. This is implemented with the following methods prefixed by (
    Add/Remove/Clear):
    - `RealtimeBroadcast.AddBroadcastEventHandler`
    - `RealtimePresence.AddPresenceEventHandler`
    - `RealtimeSocket.AddStateChangedHandler`
    - `RealtimeSocket.AddMessageReceivedHandler`
    - `RealtimeSocket.AddHeartbeatHandler`
    - `RealtimeSocket.AddErrorHandler`
    - `RealtimeClient.AddDebugHandler`
    - `RealtimeClient.AddStateChangedHandler`
    - `RealtimeChannel.AddPostgresChangeHandler`
    - `RealtimeChannel.AddMessageReceivedHandler`
    - `RealtimeChannel.AddErrorHandler`
    - `Push.AddMessageReceivedHandler`
  - [Major, new] `ClientOptions.Logger` has been removed in favor of `Client.AddDebugHandler()` which allows for
    implementing custom logging solutions if desired.
    - A simple logger can be set up with the following:
    ```c#
    client.AddDebugHandler((sender, message, exception) => Debug.WriteLine(message));
    ```
  - [Major] `Connect()` has been marked `Obsolete` in favor of `ConnectAsync()`
  - Custom reconnection logic has been removed in favor of using the built-in logic from `Websocket.Client@4.6.1`.
  - Exceptions that are handled within this library have been marked as `RealtimeException`s.
  - The local, docker-composed test suite has been brought back (as opposed to remotely testing on live supabase servers)
    to test against.
  - Comments have been added throughout the entire codebase and an `XML` file is now generated on build.

## 0.10.0 - 2023-05-14

- Changes options to require `Supabase.SupabaseOptions.SessionPersistor` from using `ISupabaseSessionHandler`
  to `IGotrueSessionPersistance<Session>` (these are now synchronous operations).
- Update dependency: gotrue-csharp@4.0.1
  - [#60](https://github.com/supabase-community/gotrue-csharp/pull/60) - Add interfaces, bug fixes, additional error
    reason detection. Thanks [@wiverson](https://github.com/wiverson)!
  - [#57](https://github.com/supabase-community/gotrue-csharp/pull/57) Refactor exceptions, code cleanup, and move to
    delegate auth state changes
    - Huge thank you to [@wiverson](https://github.com/wiverson) for his help on this refactor and release!
    - Changes
      - Exceptions have been simplified to a single `GotrueException`. A `Reason` field has been added
        to `GotrueException` to clarify what happened. This should also be easier to manage as the Gotrue
        server API & messages evolve.
      - The session delegates for `Save`/`Load`/`Destroy` have been simplified to no longer require `async`.
      - Console logging in a few places (most notable the background refresh thread) has been removed
        in favor of a notification method. See `Client.AddDebugListener()` and the test cases for examples.
        This will allow you to implement your own logging strategy (write to temp file, console, user visible
        err console, etc).
      - The client now more reliably emits AuthState changes.
      - There is now a single source of truth for headers in the stateful Client - the `Options` headers.
    - New feature:
      - Added a `Settings` request to the stateless API only - you can now query the server instance to
        determine if it's got the settings you need. This might allow for things like a visual
        component in a tool to verify the GoTrue settings are working correctly, or tests that run differently
        depending on the server configuration.
    - Implementation notes:
      - Test cases have been added to help ensure reliability of auth state change notifications
        and persistence.
      - Persistence is now managed via the same notifications as auth state change

    for [supabase-community/supabase-csharp#54](https://github.com/supabase-community/supabase-csharp/issues/54) -

- `Client` supports injection of dependent clients after initialization via property:
  - `Auth`
  - `Functions`
  - `Realtime`
  - `Postgrest`
  - `Storage`
- `SupabaseModel` contains no logic but remains for backwards compatibility. (Marked `Obsolete`)
- `ClientOptions.ShouldInitializeRealtime` was removed (no longer auto initialized)
