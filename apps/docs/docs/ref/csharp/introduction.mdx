  This reference documents every object and method available in Supabase's C# library, [supabase-csharp](https://www.nuget.org/packages/supabase-csharp). You can use supabase-csharp to interact with your Postgres database, listen to database changes, invoke Deno Edge Functions, build login and user management functionality, and manage large files.

    The C# client library is created and maintained by the Supabase community, and is not an official library. Please be tolerant of areas where the library is still being developed, and — as with all the libraries — feel free to contribute wherever you find issues.

    Huge thanks to official maintainer, [Joseph Schultz](https://github.com/acupofjose), and to [Ben Randall](https://github.com/veleek) and [Rhuan Barros](https://github.com/rhuanbarros) for their help.
