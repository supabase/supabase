The Supabase Analytics server (Logflare) manages the ingest and query pipelines for searching and aggregating structrue analytics events.

Deployed in a self-hosted environment, with the exception of API edge logs, all logs and views supported by Logflare should match the Supabase Cloud.

All logs are routed to Logflare via Vector. Kong routes API requests to PostgREST so self-hosted or local deployments will use Kong request logs instead of the Supabase Cloud API gateway.

There will be some differences in the log event payloads with self-hosted API requests vs requests handled by the Supbase Cloud API gateway.
