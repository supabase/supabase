The Supabase Analytics server is a Logflare self-hostable instance that manages the ingestion and query pipelines for searching and aggregating structured analytics events.

When self-hosting the Analytics server, the full logging experience matching that of the Supabase Platform is available in the Studio instance, allowing for an integrated and enhanced development experience.
However, it's important to note that certain [differences](#differences) may arise due to the platform's infrastructure.

## Getting Started

### Pre-requisites

Currently the Analytics service supports two backends for ingestion:

- Postgres ingestion
- Big Query ingestion

### Postgres Ingestion Requirements

- Requires you to use supabase/logflare:1.3.26 or above
- Requires the following environment variables set:
  - Required - POSTGRES_BACKEND_URL: `postgresql://{POSTGRES_USER}:{POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@{POSTGRES_HOST}:{POSTGRES_PORT}/{POSTGRES_DB}`
  - Optional - POSTGRES_BACKEND_SCHEMA: `{SCHEMA_NAME}`

### Big Query Ingestion Requirements

- Google Cloud Account with billing enabled
- Big Query enabled

The remainder of the instructions are specified in the [Setup Big Query ingestion](#setup-big-query-ingestion) section.

#### Setup Big Query ingestion

Logflare currently requires BigQuery usage. You will need to create a Google Cloud project with billing enabled.

The requirements are as follows after creating the project:

- Project ID
- Project number
- A service account key

##### Setting up BigQuery Service Account

To ensure that you have sufficient permissions to insert into your Google Cloud BigQuery, ensure that you have created a service account with either:

- BigQuery Admin role; or
- The following permissions:
  - bigquery.datasets.create
  - bigquery.datasets.get
  - bigquery.datasets.getIamPolicy
  - bigquery.datasets.update
  - bigquery.jobs.create
  - bigquery.routines.create
  - bigquery.routines.update
  - bigquery.tables.create
  - bigquery.tables.delete
  - bigquery.tables.get
  - bigquery.tables.getData
  - bigquery.tables.update
  - bigquery.tables.updateData

You can create the service account via the web console or `gcloud`, as per the [Google Cloud documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete). In the web console, you can create the key by navigating to IAM > Service Accounts > Actions (dropdown) > Manage Keys

We recommend setting the BigQuery Admin role, as it simplifies permissions setup.

##### Downloading the Service Account key

After the service account is created, you will need to create a key for the service account. This key will sign the JWTs for API requests that the Analytics server makes with BigQuery.

### Docker Compose

For analytics to work we're adding two services: Logflare and Vector.

Logflare is the analytics server that will ingest your logs into your preferred backend while Vector is the log router that will route all the docker logs using syslog unto Logflare.

#### Using the Postgres Backend

You can simply startup using the following command

```bash
# assuming you clone the supabase/supabase repo.
cd docker
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up
```

> ⚠️ WARNING: Please be aware of the heavy consumption of analytics. For heavy usage you might want to consider the usage of a different database for analytics only by updating the `POSTGRES_BACKEND_URL` in the `analytics` service on the `docker-compose.yml` file.

Also be aware that you won't be able to use [Log Explorer](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/logs#logs-explorer) when using the Postgres Backend as some of the querying features are still not supported by our translation layer.

#### Using the Big Query Backend

Using the example [self-hosting stack based on docker-compose](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/tree/master/docker), you include the logging related services using the following command

1. Update the `.env.example` file with the necessary environment variables.

- `GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID`
- `GOOGLE_PROJECT_NUMBER`

2. Place your Service Account key in your present working directory with the filename `gcloud.json`.
3. On `docker-compose.yml`, uncomment the block section below the commentary `# Uncomment to use Big Query backend for analytics`
4. On `docker-compose.yml`, comment the block section below the commentary `# Comment variables to use Big Query backend for analytics`

Thereafter, you can simply startup using the following command

```bash
# assuming you clone the supabase/supabase repo.
cd docker
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml
```

#### Vector Usage

In the Docker Compose example, we utilize vector to coordinate the logging pipeline between the services. However, if you peer into the [vector configuration file](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/master/docker/volumes/logs/vector.yml), you will be able to see that Vector sends logs to the Analytics ingestion endpoint.

If you need to customize the logging pipeline for your own needs, you must ensure that the payloads matches the expected event schema structure. Without the correct structure, it would cause the Studio Logs UI features to break.

### Standalone Docker Container

Supplementary technical documentation on self-hosting and using the `supabase/logflare` image for a full Logflare experience is available at the [official Logflare documentation](https://docs.logflare.app/self-hosting/).

## Differences

API logs rely on Kong instead of the Supabase Cloud API Gateway. Logs from Kong are not enriched with platform-only data.

Within the self-hosted setup, all logs are routed to Logflare via Vector. As Kong routes API requests to PostgREST, self-hosted or local deployments will result in Kong request logs instead.
This would result in differences in the log event metadata between self-hosted API requests and Supabase Platform requests.

## Postgres

Log event data is stored and queried from a Postgres database.

Make sure to set the `POSTGRES_BACKEND_URL` environment variable.

### Storage

All data will be stored on the Postgres Database configured by setting `POSTGRES_BACKEND_URL`

## BigQuery

All log event data is stored in and queried from BigQuery. To use the Analytics server with Supabase you'll need a Google Cloud Platform account for access to BigQuery.

Make sure to set the `GOOGLE_DATASET_ID_APPEND`, `GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID` and `GOOGLE_PROJECT_NUMBER` environment variables.

Download your Google Cloud API JWT and store it under gcloud.json in your working directory.

<Admonition>
  You must also enable billing on your Google Cloud project, as the streaming inserts feature is
  required.
</Admonition>

### Storage Location

Currently, all BigQuery datasets stored and managed by Analytics, whether via CLI or self-hosted, will default to the US region.

## Production Recommendations

To self-host in a production setting, we recommend performing the following for a better experience.

### Ensure that Logflare is behind a firewall and restrict all network access to it besides safe requests.

Self-hosted Logflare has UI authentication disabled and is intended for exposure to the internet. We recommend restricting access to the dashboard, accessible at the `/dashboard` path.
If dashboard access is required for managing sources, we recommend having an authentication layer, such as a VPN.

### Use a different Postgres Database to store Logflare data.

Logflare requires a Postgres database to function. However, if there is an issue with you self-hosted Postgres service, you would not be able to debug it as it would also bring Logflare down together.

The self-hosted example is only used as a minimal example on running the entire stack, however it is not recommended to use the same database server for both production and observability.

### Use Big Query as the Logflare Backend

The current Postgres Ingestion backend isn't optimized for production usage. We recommend using Big Query for more heavy use cases.
