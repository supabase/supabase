    An S3 compatible object storage service that integrates with Postgres.

    - Uses Postgres as it's datastore for storing metadata
    - Authorization rules are written as Postgres Row Level Security policies
    - Integrates with S3 as the storage backend (with more in the pipeline!)
    - Extremely lightweight and performant
