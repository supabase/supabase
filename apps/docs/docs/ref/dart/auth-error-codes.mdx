Supabase Auth can throw or return various errors when using the API. All errors originating from the `supabase.auth` namespace of the client library will be wrapped by the `AuthException` class.

Error objects are split in a few classes. `AuthApiException` is an exception which originates from the Supabase Auth API.

Errors originating from the server API classed as `AuthApiException` always have a `code` property that can be used to identify the error returned by the server. The `statusCode` property is also present, encoding the HTTP status code received in the response.

### Tips for better error handling

- Do not use string matching on error messages! Always use the error classes and `code` properties of error objects to identify the situation.
- Although HTTP status codes generally don't change, they can suddenly change due to bugs, so avoid relying on them unless absolutely necessary.
