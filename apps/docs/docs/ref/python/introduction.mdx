  <p>This reference documents every object and method available in the [supabase-py](https://github.com/supabase-community/supabase-py) library from the Supabase community. You can use `supabase-py` to test with your Postgres database, listen to database changes, invoke Deno Edge Functions, build login and user management functionality, and manage large files.</p>

The Python client library is created and maintained by the Supabase community, and is not an official library. Please be tolerant of areas where the library is still being developed, and — as with all the libraries — feel free to contribute wherever you find issues.

Huge thanks to official maintainers, [anand2312](https://github.com/anand2312/), [dreinon](https://github.com/dreinon), [J0](https://github.com/j0), and [Leynier](https://github.com/leynier).

Shoutout to [timkpaine](https://github.com/timkpaine) for maintaining our Conda libraries as well.
