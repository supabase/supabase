This reference documents every module and function available in Supabase's Elixir library, [supabase-ex](https://github.com/supabase-community/supabase-ex). You can use supabase-ex to interact with your Postgres database, listen to database changes, invoke Deno Edge Functions, build login and user management functionality, and manage large files.

The library is built for Elixir 1.16+ and integrates seamlessly with Phoenix, LiveView, and standalone Elixir applications. For detailed module documentation, visit [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm/supabase_potion).

<Admonition type="note">

The Elixir client library is created and maintained by the Supabase community, and is not an official library. Please be tolerant of areas where the library is still being developed, and - as with all the libraries - feel free to contribute wherever you find issues.

Huge thanks to official maintainer, [zoedsoupe](https://github.com/zoedsoupe).
