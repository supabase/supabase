This reference documents every object and method available in Supabase's isomorphic Flutter library, [`supabase-flutter`](https://pub.dev/packages/supabase_flutter).

You can use the `supabase-flutter` library to:

- interact with your Postgres database
- listen to database changes
- invoke Deno Edge Functions
- build login and user management functionality
- manage large files

## For non-Flutter projects

{/* prettier-ignore */}
We also have [supabase-dart](https://github.com/supabase-community/supabase-dart) for non-Flutter Dart projects, such as server-side Dart or Angular-Dart. supabase-dart shares most of the APIs with supabase-flutter without being dependent on Flutter so that you can use Supabase anywhere you can run Dart!
