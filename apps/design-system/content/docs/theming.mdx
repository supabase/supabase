Design System currently takes into account varying themes.

Themes currently in development:

- Light
- Dark (Classic dark)
- Deep dark

We also support a system theme, which will automatically switch between light and dark themes based on the user's system settings.

## Theme Pipeline

Supabase is migrating to use tailwind classes that use CSS properties.
This is to support the concept of theming, so that:

1. It is easy for the team to update the theme without changing 100s of files.
2. We could offer custom or additional themes in future.
