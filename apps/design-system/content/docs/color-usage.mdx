The shorthand utility classes below simplify our full color palette by providing sensible, contrast-checked defaults. Use them whenever possible to ensure accessible text colors and balanced background fills.

## Text

Use accent text colors (e.g. text-destructive, text-warning) sparingly to avoid visual overload.

<Colors definition={'text'} />

## Background

<Colors definition={'background'} />

### App backgrounds

We use backgrounds in 2 different ways. In the ./www and ./docs sites, we use a darker background, so we have an extra background color we can use

```jsx
/**
 * ./www background color
 * ./docs background color
 */
<body className="bg">{children}</body>

/**
 * ./studio background color
 */
<body className="bg-studio">{children}</body>
```

### Backgrounds and Surfaces

#### `./apps/www` + `./apps/docs`

We use surfaces in 2 different ways. In the ./www and ./docs sites, we use a darker background, so we have an extra surface color we can use

<CodeFragment name="color-usage-surface-www-and-docs" />

#### `./apps/studio`

For the studio (dashboard) we can use `bg-surface-100`, `bg-surface-200`, `bg-surface-300`

<CodeFragment name="color-usage-surface-studio" />

#### Data grid and frame space

Data grids use an alternative background color for empty space to add depth to the layout.
The background of the empty space is the same background as used in `./apps/docs` and `./apps/www` - although; the color has been mapped to `bg-alternative` so it works well across different themes.

<CodeFragment name="color-usage-surface-studio-frame" />

Dealing with large areas of empty space in data display should also be catered for. You can use the `bg-200` or `bg` class to fill the space.

### Overlays

We use the `./bg-overlay` background color for overlays.
This is not to be confused with `Dialogs`, they require to use the same app background color as the site.

## Border

<Colors definition={'border'} />

## Other Colors

These can also be accessed with `foreground`. Like `text-foreground-light`.

<Colors definition={'colors'} />
