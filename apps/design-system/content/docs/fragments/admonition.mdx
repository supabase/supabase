Admonition provides focus for situations that require a callout.

<ComponentPreview
  name="admonition-demo"
  className="[&_.preview>[data-orientation=vertical]]:sm:max-w-[70%]"
  peekCode
  wide
/>

Use Admonition instead of [Alert](../components/alert) unless you specifically need the primitives. If in doubt, stick with Admonition.

## Usage

```tsx
import { Admonition } from 'ui-patterns/admonition'
```

```tsx
<Admonition
  type="default"
  title="Is it accessible?"
  description="Yes. It adheres to the WAI-ARIA design pattern."
/>
```

### Buttons

Style the color of the button based upon the _context_ of the Admonition, not its inherited `type`. For example, the below `warning` Admonition has an encouraged action, so its button has `type="default"`. The `destructive` Admonition has a button that is destructive, so the button has `type="danger"`.

<ComponentPreview
  name="admonition-button"
  className="[&_.preview>[data-orientation=vertical]]:sm:max-w-[70%]"
/>

Only ever use the `primary` (green) button `type` on a `default` Admonition. Even then—given that Admonition is an isolated callout—the `primary` button `type` should rarely be used.

## Examples

### With actions

<ComponentPreview
  name="admonition-demo"
  className="[&_.preview>[data-orientation=vertical]]:sm:max-w-[70%]"
/>

### Warning

<ComponentPreview
  name="admonition-warning"
  className="[&_.preview>[data-orientation=vertical]]:sm:max-w-[70%]"
/>

There are several components that wrap the `warning` Admonition type with reusable text or functionality. These include:

- AlertError
- NoPermission

AlertError for example rolls up consistent error handling and support contact methods.

### Destructive

<ComponentPreview
  name="admonition-destructive"
  className="[&_.preview>[data-orientation=vertical]]:sm:max-w-[70%]"
/>
