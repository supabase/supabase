title: Confirmation Modal
description: A modal dialog for confirmations that require additional context or simple interaction.
component: true
---

Confirmation Modal is a convenience wrapper for confirmation flows that are more complex than a single paragraph but do not warrant a full custom dialog. It is built on top of [Dialog](../components/dialog) and provides a prop-based API for consistent confirmation patterns.

Use Confirmation Modal when the user needs extra context to make a decision, such as explanatory copy, callouts, or small form elements, and the action is not so destructive that it requires typed confirmation.

If the confirmation can be expressed as a single short paragraph, use [Alert Dialog](../components/alert-dialog). If the action is highly destructive and requires explicit typed intent, use [Text Confirm Dialog](../fragments/text-confirm-dialog). See [Modality](../ui-patterns/modality) for broader guidance on choosing the appropriate pattern.

## Usage

```tsx
'use client'

import { useState } from 'react'
import { Button } from 'ui'
import ConfirmationModal from 'ui-patterns/Dialogs/ConfirmationModal'
```

```tsx
export default function ConfirmationModalDemo() {
  const [visible, setVisible] = useState(false)

  return (
    <>
      <Button onClick={() => setVisible(true)}>Show Confirmation Modal</Button>

      <ConfirmationModal
        visible={visible}
        size="small"
        title="Resume this project"
        confirmLabel="Resume"
        confirmLabelLoading="Resuming"
        cancelLabel="Cancel"
        onConfirm={() => {
          setVisible(false)
        }}
        onCancel={() => {
          setVisible(false)
        }}
      >
        This will resume the project and restart any paused processes.
      </ConfirmationModal>
    </>
  )
}
```

## Guidelines

- **Use for moderate complexity:** Suitable when the confirmation requires more than a single sentence but does not need typed intent.
- **Avoid critical destruction:** Do not use for irreversible or high-risk actions that could benefit from stronger safeguards.
- **Keep content focused:** Include only the context needed to make the decision. If the dialog becomes a full flow, use a custom [Dialog](../components/dialog) instead.
- **Provide clear actions:** Ensure confirm and cancel labels clearly describe the outcome of each choice.
