title: Fragment components
description: Reusable composite components assembled from atom components to solve common interface needs.
---

Fragment components are pre-built composite components that combine multiple atom components to create reusable interface elements. Unlike atom components (basic building blocks like buttons and inputs) or UI patterns (guidelines for structuring entire sections), fragment components are ready-to-use solutions for specific interface needs.

These components help maintain consistency across Supabase products by providing standardized implementations for common interface patterns like data visualization, dialogs, empty states, forms, layout, and navigation.

Fragment components are imported from the `ui-patterns` package and can be used directly in your application. They encapsulate common combinations of atom components, reducing boilerplate and ensuring consistent behavior across similar features.
