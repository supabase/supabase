title: Text Confirm Dialog
description: A modal dialog that interrupts the user with important content and expects a response.
component: true
---

Requires the user to enter an exact string before they can continue with a destructive action, like deletion. Wraps the Shadcn `Dialog` component.

**When to use**:

- Highly destructive actions (deleting buckets, projects, etc.)
- When you need extra confirmation beyond a simple button click
- Actions that are irreversible and need explicit user intent

**Note**: This component also wraps `Dialog` but semantically should wrap `AlertDialog` since it's used for critical confirmations.

**Props**:

- `confirmString`: The exact string the user must type
- `confirmPlaceholder`: Placeholder for the input
- `variant`: 'default' | 'destructive' | 'warning'
- `alert`: Optional admonition object
- Other standard modal props
