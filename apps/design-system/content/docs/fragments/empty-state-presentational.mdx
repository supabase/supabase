<ComponentPreview name="empty-state-presentational-icon" peekCode />

Expects a title, description, and optional action buttons or other children.

## Props

### Text

All text should be written using active language. The title should prompt the user to take an action, and the description should clearly explain the value of doing so.

### Icon

Supports both Lucide icons and [custom icons](../icons) via the `icons` package. If neither are passed, EmptyStatePresentational falls back to Lucide’s `SquarePlus`.

See also [Empty States](../ui-patterns/empty-states).

## Examples

It’s okay (and encouraged) to repeat buttons inside of EmptyStatePresentational that are also available outside of it. The alternative—conditionally loading button placement during empty state determination—often leads to confusing layout shift.

When repeating buttons, set the `type` to `default` so the original `primary`, button remains the only `primary` action on display.
