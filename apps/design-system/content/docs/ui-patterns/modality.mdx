description: Present ephemeral information and forms.
---

## Sheets

Show temporary information that is larger than a few fields.

## Dialogs

Show basic information centered.

### Components

Fragment components:

- Confirmation Dialog

Shadcn components:

- Dialog (Shadcn): A versatile modal window used for a wider range of interactions, such as displaying a list of options, complex forms, or non-urgent information. May allow the user to dismiss it by clicking outside the dialog area or pressing the 'Escape' key, depending on the implementation.
- Alert Dialog (Shadcn): Interrupts the user's workflow to communicate critical information or warnings and requires an explicit acknowledgment or decision (e.g., "Are you sure you want to delete this?"). Typically cannot be dismissed by clicking outside the modal, forcing the user to interact with one of the provided action buttons.

Custom components built on those:

- Text Confirm Dialog (Custom): Wraps the Shadcn Dialog component.Requires the user to enter exact an exact string before they can continue with a destructive action, like deletion.
- Confirmation Modal (custom): Yet another dialog type. Wraps the Shadcn Dialog component. Often used to just show an "are you sure" plain text. Sometimes there are form elements like a dropdown or an an admonition. Advantage is that it's all wrapped up in a neat single component with props. otherwise you're dropping a bunch of things in and importing all the Dialog/AlertDialog components. So perhaps this should stay, but wrap alertdialog instead of dialog?

Deprecated:

- Modal: use Dialog instead.

### Dialog best practices

All dialogs should follow this basic advice:

- Text should reiterate what the entry button said

  - Dialog header
  - Confirmation button within Dialog

- Keep them as simple as possible
  - No layered elements like subtitles or admonitions
    - Remove `description` from TextConfirmDialog
    - Sweep full-width Admonition uses in dialog components
