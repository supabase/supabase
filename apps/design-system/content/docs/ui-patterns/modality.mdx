## Sheets

Show temporary information that is larger than a few fields.

## Dialogs

Show basic information centered.

### Components

Fragment components:

- ConfirmationDialog

Atom components:

- AlertDialog
- Dialog
- TextConfirmDialog

TBD:

- ConfirmationModal

### Dialog best practices

- Text should reiterate what the button said

- Keep them as simple as possible
  - No layered elements like subtitles or admonitions
    - Remove `description` from ConfirmationDialog
    - Sweep full-width Admonition uses in dialog components
