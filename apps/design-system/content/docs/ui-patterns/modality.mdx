title: Modality
description: Present ephemeral information and demand action.
---

Modal elements interrupt users from their current task and demand an action. They appear at the top of the visual stack, rendering everything beneath them inactive.

Given their highly interruptive nature, modal elements should be used sparingly. Some examples of their use include:

- Requiring confirmation from a user
- Alerting the user of or slowing them down before a destructive action
- Present temporary forms before an action can be completed

We have two main ways of handling modality:

- [Dialogs](#dialogs)
- [Sheets](#sheets)

The choice between the two simply comes down to the length of the content that needs to be displayed modally.

## Dialogs

For showing basic interruptive information centered on the viewport.

### Best practices

All dialogs should follow this basic advice:

1. **Text should reiterate what the entry button said**

   - Dialog header should match the action
   - Confirmation button within Dialog should be clear

2. **Keep them as simple as possible**

   - No layered elements like subtitles or admonitions unless necessary
   - Put all the focus on the actions to get out of the dialog

3. **Accessibility**
   - Always provide clear labels and descriptions
   - Ensure keyboard navigation works correctly
   - Use semantic HTML and ARIA attributes
   - For critical actions, prevent accidental dismissal

Use appropriate component for the use case. Here's a shorthand:

- Confirmations → [Alert Dialog](#alert-dialog) or [Text Confirm Dialog](#text-confirm-dialog) depending on how much of a speedbump is needed
- Interruptions or confirmations that require more than single paragraph → [Confirmation Modal](#confirmation-modal)
- Anything else bespoke: [Dialog](#dialog)

Use [Sheet](#sheets) for ephemeral forms and detailed views.

### Components

#### [Alert Dialog](../components/alert-dialog)

Use this when a single paragraph is enough.

<ComponentPreview name="alert-dialog-demo" />

Interrupts the user's workflow to communicate critical information or warnings and requires an explicit acknowledgment or decision (e.g., "Are you sure you want to delete this?"). Cannot be dismissed by clicking outside the modal, forcing the user to interact with one of the provided action buttons.

**When to use**:

- Critical confirmations (delete, destructive actions)
- Important warnings that require acknowledgment
- Actions that cannot be undone
- Situations where accidental dismissal would be problematic

#### [Text Confirm Dialog](../fragments/text-confirm-dialog)

Use a Text Confirm Dialog to slow folks down and force consideration:

<ComponentPreview name="text-confirm-dialog-demo" />

Requires the user to enter an exact string before they can continue with a destructive action, like deletion.

**When to use**:

- Highly destructive actions (deleting buckets, projects, etc.)
- When you need extra confirmation beyond a simple button click
- Actions that are irreversible and need explicit user intent

#### [Confirmation Modal](../fragments/confirmation-modal)

A convenience wrapper that simplifies common confirmation patterns. Use when you need the user to make a selection or the contents are more than a single paragraph.

<ComponentPreview name="confirmation-modal-demo" />

**When to use**:

- Simple "are you sure" confirmations
- Confirmations with optional additional content (admonitions, form elements)
- When you want a single component with convenient props instead of composing multiple AlertDialog components

**Note**: This component currently wraps `Dialog`, which allows dismissal via Escape/click-outside. For true confirmations, this should be migrated to wrap `AlertDialog` instead.

#### [Dialog](../components/dialog)

<ComponentPreview name="dialog-demo" />

A versatile modal window used for a wider range of interactions, such as displaying a list of options, complex forms, or non-urgent information. Can be dismissed by clicking outside the dialog area or pressing the 'Escape' key.

**When to use**:

- Non-critical information displays
- Forms that can be cancelled without consequences
- Content that benefits from being centered
- Multi-step workflows

## Sheets

**Purpose**: Show temporary information that is larger than a few fields, typically sliding in from the side.

### Best practices

**When to use**:

- Forms with multiple fields
- Detailed views or editors
- Settings panels
- Content that benefits from more horizontal space

**Usage**: Sheets slide in from the right (default) or can be configured to slide from other sides. They're ideal for forms and detailed content that doesn't need to be centered.

### Components

#### [Sheet](../components/sheet)

Note: Sheets block underlying content by design, since action on their contents is required for a user to proceed. If you want a sheet-like element to accompany page-level elements (such as a list of logs), you need to set ``modal={false}` like [this example](../components/sheet#nonmodal).

<ComponentPreview name="sheet-demo" />
