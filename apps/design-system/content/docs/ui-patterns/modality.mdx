title: Modality
description: Present ephemeral information and demand action.
---

Modal elements interrupt the user’s current task to ask for input, a decision, or focused attention. They appear at the top of the visual stack and (by default) render everything beneath them inactive.

Given their highly interruptive nature, modal elements should be used sparingly. Common use cases include:

- Requiring confirmation from the user
- Requiring an ephemeral form submission from the user before an action can be completed
- Alerting or slowing the user down before a destructive action

We have two main ways of handling modality:

- [Dialogs](#dialogs)
- [Sheets](#sheets)

As a general rule: use dialogs for short, focused tasks and use sheets for longer forms or more detailed views.

## Dialogs

Dialogs are centered overlays used for short, focused tasks. All dialogs should follow these best practices:

- **Reiterative:** Dialog header and confirmation button text and should match the action and flow on from the entry point.
- **Simple:** No layered elements like subtitles or admonitions unless necessary. Put all the focus on the actions to get out of the dialog.
- **Accessible:** Always provide clear labels and descriptions via semantic HTML and the correct ARIA attributes. Ensure keyboard navigation works correctly.

### Components

There are quite a few dialog components, each suited to a different task or context:

- [Alert Dialog](../components/alert-dialog) contains a single, short paragraph and an explicit action.
- [Text Confirm Dialog](../fragments/text-confirm-dialog) requires a textual response before the action is enabled.
- [Confirmation Modal](../fragments/confirmation-modal) provides more flexible dialog body contents.
- [Dialog](../components/dialog) is a generalized component for bespoke purposes.

#### Alert Dialog

[Alert Dialog](../components/alert-dialog) is used to confirm or acknowledge a critical action with a single, short paragraph and a clear decision.

<ComponentPreview name="alert-dialog-demo" />

#### Text Confirm Dialog

[Text Confirm Dialog](../fragments/text-confirm-dialog) adds a deliberate speed bump for highly destructive actions by requiring the user to type an exact confirmation string before proceeding.

<ComponentPreview name="text-confirm-dialog-demo" />

#### Confirmation Modal

[Confirmation Modal](../fragments/confirmation-modal) is a convenience wrapper for less-critical confirmations that require more than a single paragraph, such as additional context, callouts, or simple form elements.

<ComponentPreview name="confirmation-modal-demo" />

#### Dialog

[Dialog](../components/dialog) is a general-purpose modal for bespoke flows such as forms, pickers, or non-critical interactions where dismissal is acceptable.

<ComponentPreview name="dialog-demo" />

## Sheets

Sheets are dialogs presented as side panels. Use them for content that is larger than a few fields, or when a centered dialog would feel cramped.

- **Use for**: multi-field forms, editors, settings panels, and detailed views.
- **Prefer the default**: sheets slide in from the right unless you have a strong reason to use another side.
- **Group content**: use header/sections/footer so the user can scan and act quickly.

### Components

#### Sheet

[Sheet](../components/sheet) is modal by default, blocking interaction with the underlying page.
