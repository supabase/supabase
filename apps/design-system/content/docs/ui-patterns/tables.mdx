Tables are a fundamental pattern for displaying structured data in rows and columns. They provide a scannable, organized way to present collections of related information, making it easy for users to compare values, identify patterns, and take action on specific items.

The choice of table component depends on several factors: the complexity of the data, the level of interactivity required, the amount of data being displayed, and the context within the page layout.

## Components

There are three main table components, each optimized for different use cases:

[Table](../components/table) is a low-level, presentational table component.
[Data Table](../components/data-table) builds on Table and TanStack Table to provide a feature-rich data browsing experience (sorting, filtering, pagination, etc.).
Data Grid is a separate grid implementation used for highly interactive, spreadsheet-like surfaces and very large datasets.

### Table

The [Table](../components/table) component is designed for simple, static tabular data presentation. Use it when:

- Displaying a fixed, known number of rows
- The data is primarily read-only
- Sort, filter, or search actions are not required or can be basic

### Data Table

The [Data Table](../components/data-table) component is designed for immersive, data-heavy experiences. Use it when:

- Displaying large datasets that require pagination
- Users need to perform complex sort, filter, or search actions through the data
- Row selection is required
- The table is the primary focus of the page
- Full-viewport layouts are appropriate

## Data Grid

Studio-only.
