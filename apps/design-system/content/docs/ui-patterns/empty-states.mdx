Empty states convey the fact that there is nothing to list, perform, or display on the current page. **Ideally**, they also provide a clear action for the user to take.

## Missing route

Users may accidentally navigate to a non-existent dynamic route, such as a non-existent bucket in [Storage](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/storage) or a non-existent table in the [Table Editor](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/editor). In these cases, follow the pattern of a centered [Admonition](../fragments/admonition) as shown below.

## Zero results

Tabular information without results—or perhaps no data to begin with—should have an empty state that matches its larger presentation.

### Table

A [Table](../components/table) instance with zero results should display a single row. Dulling the TableHead text color and removing the TableCell hover state can further reinforce the lack of usable data.

### DataGrid

[DataGrid](../components/data-table) typically spans the full height and width of a container. A classic example is [Users](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/users), which displays a large DataGrid of the project’s registered users. Any instance with zero results should display a more prominent empty with a clear title, description, and supporting illustration.

## Initial state

Perhaps the user has not yet created any data yet. They might be a feature for the first time. In these cases, the empty state should provide the briefest information about the lack of data, putting more focus on the value proposition and primary action.

Keep in mind that this empty state will likely appear after a visual loading state. Consider layout shift and button placement during and after the transition.

## Components

There is not yet a shared empty state UI component. The context and needs for each placement differ enough to warrant custom components for each placement. That said, we should aim to make these as consistent as possible over time. See the below examples that might share common logic in a future centralized component.
