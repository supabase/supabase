Accessibility is about making an interface work for as many people as possible across as many circumstances as possible. All of us lean on affordances that accessible experiences provide:

- Keyboard navigation
- Legible and resizable elements
- Large tap targets
- Clear and simple language

## Checklist

About to push some code? At a minimum, check your work against this list:

- Are interactive page elements [keyboard-focusable](#focus-management)?
- Are all elements announcable by a [screen reader](#screen-reader-support)?
- Are textual elements legible and scalable?
- Can I use this on a smaller and/or older device?

## Focus management

All interactive page elements should be reachable by keyboard. Browsers such as Safari require the `tabIndex` to be explicitly set for elements to be recognised.

Interactive page elements should also provide visual feedback upon selection via a `focus-visible` state. We use consistent focus styles such as `inset-focus` so users recognize this state instantly.

[Button](../components/button) has all of the above built-in. Bespoke interactive elements however, such as the below clickable [TableRow](../components/table), require these props to be added manually:

```tsx showLineNumbers {3, 5-11}
<TableRow
  key={id}
  className="relative cursor-pointer h-16 inset-focus"
  onClick={(event) => handleBucketNavigation(name, event)}
  onKeyDown={(event) => {
    if (event.key === 'Enter' || event.key === ' ') {
      event.preventDefault()
      handleBucketNavigation(name, event)
    }
  }}
  tabIndex={0}
>
  <TableCell>
    <p>{name}</p>
  </TableCell>
</TableRow>
```

The TableRow itself must be made interactive (rather than an absolutely-positioned button inside) for it to work reliably in all browsers. Consider also affordances like `ctrl` and `meta` key support for opening in a new tab. Anything that you can do with a mouse input should be replicable by keyboard.

## Screen readers

Textual elements are supported out-of-the-box by screen readers.

### Imagery

Images should have their contents described with an `alt` attribute. Write an objective description of the content rather than its context. For example:

```tsx showLineNumbers {2}
// Correct: painting a picture with words
<img src="beagle.png" alt="A tricolor beagle galloping through a grassy field, ears in the air" />

// Incorrect: Unhelpful context
<img src="beagle.png" alt="Our logo" />
```

Icons and other visual elements that aren’t strictly images should use the `aria-label` attribute. For example:

```tsx showLineNumbers {2}
<BucketTableCell>
  <BucketIcon aria-label="bucket icon" size={16} />
</BucketTableCell>
```

Visual elements that are _purely_ visual aids may be removed from the accessibility tree via the `aria-hidden` attribute. For example:

```tsx showLineNumbers {2}
<BucketTableCell>
  <ChevronRight aria-hidden={true} size={14} />
</BucketTableCell>
```

Never use `aria-hidden={true}` on focusable elements, since these are critical pieces of functionality.

### Scaffolding

Some scaffolding elements only make sense visually, in the context of surrounding visual content. For example: a table column for actions may not have a visual _Actions_ label because its purpose is obvious (by nearby contents) to a sighted person. For everyone else’s sake, this column should be titled with `sr-only` text:

```tsx showLineNumbers {2}
<TableHead>
  <span className="sr-only">Actions</span>
</TableHead>
```
