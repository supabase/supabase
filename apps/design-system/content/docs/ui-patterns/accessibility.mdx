Accessibility is about making an interface work for as many people as possible across as many circumstances as possible. All of us lean on affordances that accessible experiences provide:

- Keyboard navigation
- Legible and resizable elements
- Large tap targets
- Clear and simple language

## Checklist

About to push some code? At a minimum, check your work against this list:

- Are interactive page elements [keyboard-focusable](#focus-management)?
- Are all elements announcable by a [screen reader](#screen-reader-support)?
- Are textual elements legible and scalable?
- Can I use this on a smaller and/or older device?

## Focus management

All interactive page elements should be reachable by keyboard. They should also provide visual feedback upon selection via a `focus-visible` state. We use consistent focus styles such as `inset-focus` so users recognize this state instantly.

```jsx
<TableCell>
  <p>{name}</p>
  <button
    className={cn('absolute inset-0', 'inset-focus')}
    onClick={(event) => handleBucketNavigation(name, event)}
  >
    <span className="sr-only">Go to bucket details</span>
  </button>
</TableCell>
```

Consider also affordances like `ctrl` and `meta` key support for opening in a new tab. Anything that you can do with a mouse input should be replicable by keyboard.

## Screen reader support

Textual elements are supported out-of-the-box by screen readers. Imagery of course should be described by `alt` tags.

Less obvious however are scaffolding elements that only makes sense visually, when paired with other content. For example: a table column for actions may not have a visual _Actions_ label because its purpose is obvious to a sighted person. For everyone else’s sake, this column should be titled with `sr-only` text:

```jsx
<TableHead>
  <span className="sr-only">Actions</span>
</TableHead>
```
