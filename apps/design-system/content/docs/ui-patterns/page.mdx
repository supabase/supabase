The Page pattern consists of three main components that work together to create consistent page layouts: `PageContainer`, `PageHeader`, and `PageSection`. These components provide a structured approach to building pages with consistent spacing, max-widths, and content organization.

## Layouts

### Settings

Settings pages are used for configuration and preference management. They follow a single-column layout with default widths to keep content focused and readable.

- Use `PageHeader` with `size="default"`
- Use `PageContainer` with `size="default"`
- Use `PageSection` for organizing settings into logical groups

### List

List pages display collections of objects like tables, triggers, or functions. These pages use larger widths to accommodate wide content like data tables.

- Use `PageHeader` with `size="large"`
- Use `PageContainer` with `size="large"`
- Use `PageSection` to wrap list content

**Table and List Actions:**

- **With filters or search:** If the table has filters or search, place table actions aligned with the filters on the right side. Do not use `PageSectionAside` or `PageHeaderAside` for table actions when filters are present.
- **Without filters:** For simple lists without filters or search, add primary list actions to `PageHeaderAside` or `PageSectionAside` as appropriate.

### Data and Full Page Experiences

Full-page experiences like editors require maximum screen real estate. These pages use full-width containers to maximize available space.

- Use `PageHeader` with `size="full"`
- Use `PageContainer` with `size="full"`
- Content spans the full width of the viewport

### Detail Pages

Detail pages display dense or lengthy content split into multiple sections. The horizontal orientation allows for better information hierarchy and context.

- Use `PageHeader` with `size="large"`
- Use `PageContainer` with `size="large"`
- Use `PageSection` with `orientation="horizontal"` to show summary alongside content
- Multiple sections can stack vertically with horizontal layouts within each

## Components

- **[PageContainer](/docs/fragments/page-container)** - Container component providing consistent max-width and padding based on size variants
- **[PageHeader](/docs/fragments/page-header)** - Compound component for building page headers with breadcrumbs, icons, titles, descriptions, actions, and navigation
- **[PageSection](/docs/fragments/page-section)** - Compound component for organizing page content into distinct sections with title, description, and action areas
