Forms in Supabase Studio follow consistent patterns to ensure a cohesive user experience across settings pages and side panels. This guide covers the most common form patterns and field types.

## Overview

Forms in Supabase Studio follow these key principles:

- **Page structure**: Every page has a title and optional subtitle
- **Sub navigation**: Pages can have sub navigation via tabs
- **Sections**: Settings pages are broken down into sections
- **Section structure**: Each section can have a title and a subtitle
- **Card containers**: Forms or actions within a section are contained within a Card
- **Field alignment**: Fields within a form are generally horizontally aligned
- **Save actions**: Long settings pages with multiple sections can have a save action per section
- **Action positioning**: Save actions are positioned at the bottom of form cards and stick to the bottom
- **Section actions**: Section actions are also horizontally aligned

## Form Layout Patterns

### PageLayout Pattern

Forms in page layouts typically use `PageSection` components with `Card` containers. Fields use `FormItemLayout` with `layout="flex-row-reverse"` for horizontal alignment.

### SidePanel/Sheet Pattern

Forms in side panels (Sheets) use `FormItemLayout` with `layout="horizontal"` or `layout="vertical"` depending on available width. The form is typically wrapped in a `Sheet` component.

## Best Practices

1. **Always use FormItemLayout**: Use `FormItemLayout` instead of manually composing `FormItem`, `FormLabel`, `FormMessage`, and `FormDescription`.

2. **Layout selection**:

   - Use `layout="flex-row-reverse"` for page layouts (horizontal alignment)
   - Use `layout="horizontal"` for side panels with more width
   - Use `layout="vertical"` for side panels with limited width

3. **Wrap inputs in FormControl*Shadcn***: Always wrap form inputs with `FormControl_Shadcn_` to ensure proper form integration.

4. **Use Cards for grouping**: Wrap form sections in `Card` components with `CardContent` and `CardFooter` for actions.

5. **Handle dirty state**: Show cancel buttons and disable save buttons based on `form.formState.isDirty`.

6. **Error handling**: Always use mutations with `onSuccess` and `onError` callbacks that show toast notifications.

7. **Loading states**: Show loading states on submit buttons using the `loading` prop.

8. **Form IDs**: When submit buttons are outside the form, use a form ID and reference it with the `form` prop on the button.
