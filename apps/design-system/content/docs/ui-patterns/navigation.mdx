Supabase has a necessarily complex navigation system to handle multiple products and levels of hierarchy. This page introduces those general patterns, best practices, and the components involved.

## Row interaction

Both [TableRow](../components/table-row) and [Card](../components/card) may be used to represent rows of data. Their individual interactivity depends on the context, such as:

- Does the larger container represent mostly read-only content or is it an entry way into child routes?
- Is there only one action on each row?
- Does the row represent a single entity or a collection of entities?

## Entirely clickable rows

Where there is perhaps one primary action, and one or two overlapping (and therefore conflicting) secondary actions.

_TODO: example like the Security email templates rows_

These mostly only make sense for Card components, as their content tends to be more about navigation than representing data.

`e.stopPropagation()` is used to prevent the click event from bubbling up to the parent row, which would cause the row to be clicked instead of the link.

Be sure to add enough padding to each overriding interactive element to ensure the click target is large enough. Otherwise the click can feel hijacked if the user misclicks by even a few pixels.

### Secondary actions

Use the `.text-link-table-cell` class to style secondary actions.

```tsx
<TableCell>
  <Link href="/bucket-name-here" className="text-link-table-cell">
    Bucket name here
  </Link>
</TableCell>
```

Chain additional classes to the Link if there are multiple actions on the same row.

```tsx
<TableCell>
  <Link href="/bucket-name-here" className="text-link-table-cell text-medium">
    Bucket name here
  </Link>
</TableCell>
<TableCell>
  <Link href="/bucket-name-here/policies" className="text-link-table-cell text-foreground-lighter">
    Policies
  </Link>
</TableCell>
```

## Components

### NavMenu

A horizontal list of related views within a consistent PageLayout context, allowing for clearer page-level organisation. Activating a NavMenu item should trigger a URL change.
