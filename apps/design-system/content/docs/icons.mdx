## Principles

1. Paired: Icons should accompany text, as they aren’t often obvious enough on their own.
2. Clear: Icons should be legible at small sizes and unembellished. Let the text do the heavy lifting.
3. Consistent: Use the same icons for similar actions throughout Supabase. This makes the app easier to use.

## Tints

Use classes just like you would for [text](color-usage#text) to tint icons. For example:

```jsx
<BucketAdd className="text-foreground-muted" />
```

Just like text, don’t tint icons with `text-destructive` for destructive actions. There should be a confirmation dialog right after which can handle the destructive styling.

## UI icons

We rely on [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/icons/) for any standard UI icon needs.

## Custom icons

Create and use custom icons when Lucide doesn’t have the icon you need. Tap on an icon below to copy the JSX, SVG, or import path.

<Icons />

### Usage

```jsx
import { BucketAdd, InsertCode, ReplaceCode } from 'icons'

function app() {
  return (
    <>
      <ReplaceCode className="text-light" strokeWidth={1} size={16} />
      <InsertCode className="text-light" strokeWidth={1} size={16} />
      <BucketAdd size={24} className="text-foreground-muted" />
    </>
  )
}
```

**Default props**: All icons have `strokeWidth={2}` and `size={24}` by default. Override these props as needed for your use case.

### Adding new custom icons

Follow these steps to add a new custom icon to the Supabase icon library.

1. **Create SVG file**: Add your SVG file to `packages/icons/src/raw-icons/` with a kebab-case name (e.g., `my-new-icon.svg`). Make sure it has follows these exact requirements:

   - Exported at 24x24px with `viewBox="0 0 24 24"`
   - Uses `stroke="currentColor"` for strokes (no hardcoded colors)
   - Uses `stroke-width="1.5"` unless there is a good reason to deviate
   - Uses `fill="none"` for fills (no hardcoded colors)
   - Icon content is optically centered and around 18x18px within the 24x24 frame
   - Any unnecessary elements like `<clipPath>`, `<defs>`, and `<g>` wrappers have been removed
   - SVG structure is as simple as possible with just `<path>` elements

Leave attributes like `stroke-width` as they are. The conversion to camel-case for React compatibility (e.g. `strokeWidth`) is handled by the below build process.

2. **Build the component**: Run `npm run build:icons` from inside the `packages/icons` directory

3. **Use the icon**: Import and use like any other icon:

```tsx
import { MyNewIcon } from 'icons'
;<MyNewIcon size={16} strokeWidth={1} />
```

The icon name is automatically made available in camel-case, determined by the kebab-case input SVG. For example, `my-new-icon.svg` will become available as `MyNewIcon`.

### SVG design guidelines

Icons should:

- Always be exported 24x24px
- Have an icon inside that frame that’s around 18x18px(ish)
- Use clean, simple paths without unnecessary wrapper elements

#### Bad example ❌

Notice the hardcoded colors, unnecessary backgrounds, and complex structure:

```svg
<svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <rect width="24" height="24" fill="#1E1E1E" /> <!-- ❌ Hardcoded color -->
  <path d="M..." fill="#404040" /> <!-- ❌ Hardcoded color -->
  <path d="M..." stroke="#EDEDED" stroke-linecap="round" /> <!-- ❌ Hardcoded color -->
</svg>
```

#### Good example ✅

Clean structure with `currentColor` and proper attributes:

```svg
<svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="1.5" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round">
  <path d="M6 7C6 4.2 8.2 2 11 2H13C15.8 2 18 4.2 18 7" />
  <path d="M4.5 11H19.5" />
  <path d="M6 11L6.8 20C6.9 21.1 7.9 22 9 22H12" />
</svg>
```

{/* This is still wrong: */}

```svg
<svg width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <path d="M6 7C6 4.2 8.2 2 11 2H13C15.8 2 18 4.2 18 7" />
  <path d="M4.5 11H19.5" />
  <path d="M6 11L6.8 20C6.9 21.1 7.9 22 9 22H12" />
</svg>
```

### Troubleshooting

If your SVG specifies `stroke-width` attributes, they will override the component's `strokeWidth` prop. Remove stroke attributes from individual paths to let the component control them.
