## Principles

1. Paired: Icons should accompany text, as they aren’t often obvious enough on their own.
2. Clear: Icons should be legible at small sizes and unembellished. Let the text do the heavy lifting.
3. Consistent: Use the same icons for similar actions throughout Supabase. This makes the app easier to use.

## Tints

Destructive actions, such as deleting an API key, don’t need to be [tinted](color-usage#text) with `text-destructive` because there should be a confirmation dialog as a failsafe right after.

## UI Icons

We rely on Lucide icons for most of our UI icons.
