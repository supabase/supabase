title: Atom components
description: Fundamental building blocks of user interfaces, based on shadcn/ui components.

Atom components are the fundamental building blocks of our design system. These are primitive, single-purpose components that serve as the foundation for building more complex interfaces. Unlike fragment components (pre-built composite components) or UI patterns (guidelines for structuring sections), atom components are the smallest reusable units that can be composed together.

These components are based on [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) and live in the `ui` package, making them shareable across all Supabase applications. They provide consistent styling, accessibility, and behavior for common interface elements like buttons, inputs, cards, dialogs, and form controls.

Atom components are imported from the `ui` package and can be used directly or combined to create fragment components and implement UI patterns. They form the base layer of our component architecture, ensuring visual and functional consistency across the entire design system.
