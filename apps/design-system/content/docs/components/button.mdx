<ComponentPreview name="button-demo" peekCode wide />

## Usage

```tsx
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'
```

```tsx
<Button type="outline">Button</Button>
```

_It is likely that the `type` prop will be changed to `variant` in the future._

## Link

You can use the `buttonVariants` helper to create a link that looks like a button.

```tsx
import { buttonVariants } from '@/components/ui/button'
```

```tsx
<Link className={buttonVariants({ variant: 'outline' })}>Click here</Link>
```

Alternatively, you can set the `asChild` parameter and nest the link component.

```tsx
<Button asChild>
  <Link href="/login">Login</Link>
</Button>
```

## Examples

### Sizes

Use the `size` prop to determine the size of the button.

<ComponentPreview name="button-sizes" />

### Types

These are all the different `type` variations.

#### Primary

Used for data insertion actions, confirming purchases, strong positive actions.

<ComponentPreview name="button-demo" />

#### Default

Used for opening dialogs, navigating to pages, and other non CRUD actions.

This `type` will probably be the most used button type.
It will probably be changed to be the default type in future.

<ComponentPreview name="button-default" />

#### Secondary

Can be used for signaling a data or config change, but not as serious as a primary button.
For destructuve or side effect actions, use the `destructive` or `warning` type.

<ComponentPreview name="button-secondary" />

#### Warning

Used for actions that might have a side effect, but not as serious as a destructive action.

<ComponentPreview name="button-warning" />

#### Destructive (currently `danger`)

<ComponentPreview name="button-outline" />

#### Ghost (currently `text`)
