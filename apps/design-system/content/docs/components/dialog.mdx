Dialog is a flexible, general-purpose modal used for bespoke interactions such as forms, pickers, multi-step flows, or displaying non-urgent information. Unlike confirmation-focused dialogs, it is designed to be safely dismissible and does not force an explicit decision.

Dialog can be closed by clicking outside the modal or pressing the Escape key, making it suitable for workflows where cancellation is expected and low-risk.

Use Dialog when you need full control over layout, content, and behavior, and the interaction does not involve a critical or destructive action.

For confirmations or warnings, try to use an existing component:

- Use [Alert Dialog](../components/alert-dialog) for critical confirmations that require an explicit decision
- Use [Confirmation Modal](../fragments/confirmation-modal) when additional context is needed for a confirmation
- Use [Text Confirm Dialog](../fragments/text-confirm-dialog) for highly destructive actions that require typed intent

See [Modality](../ui-patterns/modality) for guidance on choosing the appropriate dialog pattern.

## Usage

```tsx
import {
  Dialog,
  DialogContent,
  DialogDescription,
  DialogHeader,
  DialogTitle,
  DialogTrigger,
} from '@/components/ui/dialog'
```

```tsx
<Dialog>
  <DialogTrigger>Open</DialogTrigger>
  <DialogContent>
    <DialogHeader>
      <DialogTitle>Project settings</DialogTitle>
      <DialogDescription>
        Update configuration options for this project. Changes can be discarded at any time.
      </DialogDescription>
    </DialogHeader>
    {/* Custom content goes here */}
  </DialogContent>
</Dialog>
```

## Guidelines

- **Use for non-critical interactions:** Dialog is appropriate when dismissal has no serious consequences.
- **Design for cancellation**: Assume users may close the dialog without completing the action.
- **Keep focus contained**: Dialog content should remain scoped to a single task or flow.
- **Avoid destructive confirmations**: If the dialog’s primary purpose is to confirm a risky action, use a confirmation-focused pattern instead.
- **Compose freely**: Dialog is intentionally unopinionated. Build custom layouts, forms, or step-based flows as needed.

## Examples

### Custom close button

<ComponentPreview name="dialog-close-button" />

### Centered behavior

You can control whether the dialog is centered by passing `centered={false}` to the `DialogContent` component.

```tsx {3}
<Dialog>
  <ContextMenuTrigger>Click here</ContextMenuTrigger>
  <DialogContent centered={false}>
    {/*
     * Content in here
     */}
  </DialogContent>
</Dialog>
```

<ComponentPreview name="dialog-centered-off" />

## Notes

To activate the `Dialog` component from within a `Context Menu` or `Dropdown Menu`, you must encase the `Context Menu` or
`Dropdown Menu` component in the `Dialog` component. For more information, refer to the linked issue [here](https://github.com/radix-ui/primitives/issues/1836).

```tsx {7-11, 14-23}
<Dialog>
  <ContextMenu>
    <ContextMenuTrigger>Show Menu</ContextMenuTrigger>
    <ContextMenuContent>
      <ContextMenuItem>Open</ContextMenuItem>
      <ContextMenuItem>Download</ContextMenuItem>
      <DialogTrigger asChild>
        <ContextMenuItem>
          <span>Show Dialog</span>
        </ContextMenuItem>
      </DialogTrigger>
    </ContextMenuContent>
  </ContextMenu>
  <DialogContent>
    <DialogHeader>
      <DialogTitle>Edit profile</DialogTitle>
      <DialogDescription>Make changes to your profile here.</DialogDescription>
    </DialogHeader>
    <DialogFooter>
      <Button>Save changes</Button>
    </DialogFooter>
  </DialogContent>
</Dialog>
```
