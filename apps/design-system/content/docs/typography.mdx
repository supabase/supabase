description: An overview of all available typography CSS variables.

Some reusable patterns work better as CSS variables, or “shorthands”, than as components. Typography is one of these cases, since its usage and context vary widely.

The shorthands below are composed of core [Tailwind utility classes](../docs/tailwind-classes). You can view the full list of shorthands in [`typography.scss`](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/master/apps/studio/styles/typography.scss).

## Shorthands

| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `text-code-inline` | Apply to a `code` element for inline code or similar custom inline content   |
