title: Copywriting
description: A concise guide for writing UI copy in Supabase.
---

Write UI copy that helps developers complete tasks quickly. Be direct, action-oriented, and respectful of developer time.

## Voice and tone

Supabase UI copy is:

- **Direct**: Say what something does, not what it "enables" you to do.
- **Action-oriented**: Focus on what happens, not what we built.
- **Technical without jargon**: Use precise terms but explain when necessary.
- **Pragmatic**: Acknowledge tradeoffs and limitations when relevant.

## Buttons and actions

### Use verbs, not nouns

<ComponentPreview name="copy-button-verbs" hideCode />

### Be specific about outcomes

| Bad         | Good             |
| ----------- | ---------------- |
| "Remove"    | "Delete project" |
| "Change"    | "Revoke access"  |
| "Configure" | "Enable RLS"     |

### Match button text to the action

| Action            | Bad       | Good           |
| ----------------- | --------- | -------------- |
| Primary action:   | "Submit"  | "Create table" |
| Secondary action: | "Go back" | "Cancel"       |

## Form labels and descriptions

### Labels describe the field, not the feature

<ComponentPreview name="copy-form-labels" hideCode />

| Action       | Bad                                                                                              | Good                                     |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Label:       | "Name your table"                                                                                | "Table name"                             |
| Description: | "This field allows you to specify a name for your table using letters, numbers, and underscores" | "Letters, numbers, and underscores only" |

### Descriptions explain constraints, not concepts

| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| "This ensures your table name is unique"                        | "Must be unique within the schema" |
| "You can enter up to 255 characters here"                       | "Maximum 255 characters"           |
| "This field is required when using Row Level Security policies" | "Required for RLS policies"        |

### Use present tense

| Bad                                    | Good                              |

## Capitalization

- **Sentence case** for all UI text (buttons, labels, headings)
- **Product names:** Database, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions, Realtime, Vector
- **Postgres**, not PostgreSQL
- **Supabase** (capitalize except in code)

## Formatting

- **Bold for emphasis** only when necessary
- **Inline code** for technical terms: `RLS`, `API key`, `supabase init`
- **No italics** for emphasis
- **No exclamation marks** unless critical (e.g., destructive actions)

## Quick checklist

Before publishing UI copy, ask:

- Does it use an action verb?
- Is it specific about what happens?
- Can a developer complete the task without reading more?
- Does it avoid marketing language?
- Is it in sentence case?
- Is it one sentence or less (for labels, buttons, tooltips)?
