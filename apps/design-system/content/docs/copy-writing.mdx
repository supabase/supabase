description: A concise guide for writing UI copy in Supabase.
---

Write UI copy that helps developers complete tasks quickly. Be direct, action-oriented, and respectful of developer time.

## Voice and tone

Supabase UI copy is:

- **Direct**: Say what something does, not what it "enables" you to do.
- **Action-oriented**: Focus on what happens, not what we built.
- **Technical without jargon**: Use precise terms but explain when necessary.
- **Pragmatic**: Acknowledge tradeoffs and limitations when relevant.

## Buttons and actions

### Use verbs, not nouns

**Good:**
- "Create table"
- "Save changes"
- "Delete bucket"

**Bad:**
- "Table creation"
- "Save action"
- "Bucket deletion"

### Be specific about outcomes

**Good:**
- "Delete project"
- "Revoke access"
- "Enable RLS"

**Bad:**
- "Remove"
- "Change"
- "Configure"

### Match button text to the action

**Good:**
- Primary action: "Create table"
- Secondary action: "Cancel"

**Bad:**
- Primary action: "Submit"
- Secondary action: "Go back"

## Form labels and descriptions

### Labels describe the field, not the feature

**Good:**
- Label: "Table name"
- Description: "Letters, numbers, and underscores only"

**Bad:**
- Label: "Name your table"
- Description: "This field allows you to specify a name for your table using letters, numbers, and underscores"

### Descriptions explain constraints, not concepts

**Good:**
- "Must be unique within the schema"
- "Maximum 255 characters"
- "Required for RLS policies"

**Bad:**
- "This ensures your table name is unique"
- "You can enter up to 255 characters here"
- "This field is required when using Row Level Security policies"

### Use present tense

**Good:**
- "Stores connection pool settings"
- "Limits query execution time"

**Bad:**
- "Will store connection pool settings"
- "This will limit query execution time"

## Error messages

### State what went wrong, then how to fix it

**Good:**
- "Table name already exists. Choose a different name."
- "Invalid API key. Check your project settings."

**Bad:**
- "An error occurred"
- "Something went wrong. Please try again."

### Be specific about the problem

**Good:**
- "Password must be at least 8 characters"
- "Connection failed: timeout after 30 seconds"

**Bad:**
- "Invalid input"
- "Connection error"

### Avoid blame or apology

**Good:**
- "Unable to connect to database"
- "Table creation failed: column name is reserved"

**Bad:**
- "Sorry, we couldn't connect"
- "Oops! Something went wrong"

## Success messages

### Confirm what happened

**Good:**
- "Table created successfully"
- "API key revoked"
- "Changes saved"

**Bad:**
- "Success!"
- "Done"
- "Operation completed"

### Keep it brief

**Good:**
- "Backup restored"
- "Migration applied"

**Bad:**
- "Your backup has been successfully restored to your database"
- "The migration has been applied successfully to your project"

## Tooltips and help text

### Explain why, not what

**Good:**
- "Enables real-time subscriptions for this table"
- "Prevents accidental deletions"

**Bad:**
- "This is a toggle switch"
- "Click to delete"

### One sentence maximum

**Good:**
- "Restricts access based on user policies"
- "Maximum number of concurrent connections"

**Bad:**
- "Row Level Security restricts access based on user policies. When enabled, users can only access rows that match their policy conditions."
- "This setting controls the maximum number of concurrent connections that can be established to your database at any given time."

## Navigation and headings

### Use sentence case

**Good:**
- "Set up authentication"
- "Database settings"
- "Create new project"

**Bad:**
- "Set Up Authentication"
- "Database Settings"
- "Create New Project"

### Headings describe the page, not the feature

**Good:**
- "API keys"
- "Connection pooling"
- "Table editor"

**Bad:**
- "Manage your API keys"
- "Configure connection pooling"
- "Edit your tables"

## Empty states

### Explain what's missing, then how to add it

**Good:**
- "No tables yet. Create your first table to get started."
- "No API keys. Generate a key to connect your application."

**Bad:**
- "You don't have any tables"
- "There are no API keys available"

### Include the action

**Good:**
- "No buckets yet. [Create bucket] button"
- "No functions deployed. [Deploy function] button"

**Bad:**
- "No buckets found"
- "No functions available"

## Loading states

### Describe what's happening

**Good:**
- "Creating table..."
- "Loading schema..."
- "Applying migration..."

**Bad:**
- "Please wait..."
- "Loading..."
- "Processing..."

### Match the action verb

**Good:**
- Action: "Delete project" → Loading: "Deleting project..."
- Action: "Save changes" → Loading: "Saving changes..."

**Bad:**
- Action: "Delete project" → Loading: "Processing..."
- Action: "Save changes" → Loading: "Please wait..."

## Confirmations and dialogs

### State consequences clearly

**Good:**
- "Delete this project? This action cannot be undone and will permanently delete all data."
- "Revoke this API key? Applications using this key will stop working immediately."

**Bad:**
- "Are you sure?"
- "This action is permanent. Continue?"

### Use active voice

**Good:**
- "Deleting this project will remove all data"
- "Revoking this key will break existing connections"

**Bad:**
- "All data will be removed if this project is deleted"
- "Existing connections will be broken if this key is revoked"

## Words to avoid

### Marketing language

**Bad:**
- "Easily create tables"
- "Simply configure settings"
- "Powerful database features"

**Good:**
- "Create tables"
- "Configure settings"
- "Database features"

### Vague verbs

**Bad:**
- "Manage tables"
- "Handle errors"
- "Work with data"

**Good:**
- "Create, edit, or delete tables"
- "View and resolve errors"
- "Query and update data"

## Capitalization

- **Sentence case** for all UI text (buttons, labels, headings)
- **Product names:** Database, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions, Realtime, Vector
- **Postgres**, not PostgreSQL
- **Supabase** (capitalize except in code)

## Formatting

- **Bold for emphasis** only when necessary
- **Inline code** for technical terms: `RLS`, `API key`, `supabase init`
- **No italics** for emphasis
- **No exclamation marks** unless critical (e.g., destructive actions)

## Quick checklist

Before publishing UI copy, ask:

- [ ] Does it use an action verb?
- [ ] Is it specific about what happens?
- [ ] Can a developer complete the task without reading more?
- [ ] Does it avoid marketing language?
- [ ] Is it in sentence case?
- [ ] Is it one sentence or less (for labels, buttons, tooltips)?
