# Supabase Design System

Design resources for building consistent user experiences at Supabase.

## Getting Started

First, make a copy of _.env.local.example_ and name it _env.local_. Then run the development server as described below.

From within this _design-system_ directory, run:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Or from the root directory run:

```bash
pnpm dev:design-system
```

Open [http://localhost:3003](http://localhost:3003) with your browser to see the result.

### Watching for MDX changes

If you would like to watch for changes to MDX files with hot reload, you can run the following command in a separate terminal shell:

```
pnpm content:dev
```

This runs Contentlayer concurrently and watches for any changes.
