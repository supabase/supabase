        The Joke Tax Chronicles
      </h1>
      <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
        Once upon a time, in a far-off land, there was a very lazy king who spent all day lounging
        on his throne. One day, his advisors came to him with a problem: the kingdom was running out
        of money.

        The King's Plan
      </h2>
      <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
        The king thought long and hard, and finally came up with{' '}
        <a href="#" className="font-medium text-primary underline underline-offset-4">
          a brilliant plan
        </a>
        : he would tax the jokes in the kingdom.
      </p>
      <blockquote className="mt-6 border-l-2 pl-6 italic">
        "After all," he said, "everyone enjoys a good joke, so it's only fair that they should pay
        for the privilege."
      </blockquote>
      <h3 className="mt-8 scroll-m-20 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight">The Joke Tax</h3>
      <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
        The king's subjects were not amused. They grumbled and complained, but the king was firm:
      </p>
      <ul className="my-6 ml-6 list-disc [&>li]:mt-2">
        <li>1st level of puns: 5 gold coins</li>
        <li>2nd level of jokes: 10 gold coins</li>
        <li>3rd level of one-liners : 20 gold coins</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
        As a result, people stopped telling jokes, and the kingdom fell into a gloom. But there was
        one person who refused to let the king's foolishness get him down: a court jester named
        Jokester.
      </p>
      <h3 className="mt-8 scroll-m-20 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight">Jokester's Revolt</h3>
      <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
        Jokester began sneaking into the castle in the middle of the night and leaving jokes all
        over the place: under the king's pillow, in his soup, even in the royal toilet. The king was
        furious, but he couldn't seem to stop Jokester.
      </p>
      <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
        And then, one day, the people of the kingdom discovered that the jokes left by Jokester were
        so funny that they couldn't help but laugh. And once they started laughing, they couldn't
        stop.
      </p>
      <h3 className="mt-8 scroll-m-20 text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight">
        The People's Rebellion
      </h3>
      <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
        The people of the kingdom, feeling uplifted by the laughter, started to tell jokes and puns
        again, and soon the entire kingdom was in on the joke.
