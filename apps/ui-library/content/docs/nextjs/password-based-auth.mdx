## Installation

<BlockItem
  name="password-based-auth-nextjs"

<RegistryBlock itemName="password-based-auth-nextjs" />

## Usage

Once you install the block in your Next.js project, you'll get all the necessary pages and components to set up a password-based authentication flow.

### Getting started

First, add a `.env` file to your project with the following environment variables:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
```

- If you're using supabase.com, you can find these values in the [Connect modal](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_?showConnect=true) under App Frameworks or in your project's [API settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/api).

- If you're using a local instance of supabase, you can find these values by running `supabase start` or `supabase status` (if you already have it running).

### Adding email templates

1. Add an [email template for sign-up](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/templates) to the Supabase project. Your signup email template should contain at least the following HTML:

   ```html
   <h2>Confirm your signup</h2>

   <p>Follow this link to confirm your user:</p>
   <p>
     <a
       href="{{ .SiteURL }}/auth/confirm?token_hash={{ .TokenHash }}&type=email&next={{ .RedirectTo }}"
       >Confirm your email</a
     >
   </p>
   ```

   For detailed instructions on how to configure your email templates, including the use of variables like `{{ .SiteURL }}`,`{{ .TokenHash }}`, and `{{ .RedirectTo }}`, refer to our [Email Templates guide](https://supabase.com/docs/email-templates).

1. Add an [email template for reset password](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/templates) to the Supabase project. Your reset password email template should contain at least the following HTML:

   ```html
   <h2>Reset Password</h2>

   <p>Follow this link to reset the password for your user:</p>
   <p>
     <a
       href="{{ .SiteURL }}/auth/confirm?token_hash={{ .TokenHash }}&type=recovery&next={{ .RedirectTo }}"
       >Reset Password</a
     >
   </p>
   ```

### Setting up routes and redirect URLs

1. Set the site URL in the [URL Configuration](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/url-configuration) settings in the Supabase Dashboard.
1. Set up the Next.js route users will visit to reset or update their password. First, update the `forgot-password-form.tsx` component with your `forgot-password` route. You'll need to tell Supabase to allow this route as the redirect URL. Go to the [URL Configuration](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/url-configuration) settings and add that route to the list of Redirect URLs. It should look something like: `http://example.com/auth/forgot-password`.

1. Update the redirect paths in the `login-form.tsx` and `update-password-form.tsx` components to point to the logged-in routes in your app.

<Callout type="info">

You can use this block with the Pages router by simply moving the routes from the `app` folder into the `pages` folder and renaming them. Example instead of `app/sign-up/page.tsx`, you'd create a `pages/sign-up.tsx` file.
