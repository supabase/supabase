<Callout className="mt-4">
  Select which providers to enable below. The generated URL will call the API route for block
  generation.
</Callout>

## Installation

Select which social providers you want to be added to the block.

<GeneratedAuthBlockItem
  name="generated-auth-nextjs"
  description="All needed components for the generated auth flow"
/>

## Folder structure

This block includes the [Supabase client](/ui/docs/nextjs/client). If you already have one installed, you can skip overwriting it.

## Usage

Once you install the block in your Next.js project, you'll get all the necessary pages and components to set up authentication flow with the specified providers.

### Getting started

After installing the block, you'll have the following environment variables in your `.env.local` file:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_OR_ANON_KEY=
```

- If you're using supabase.com, you can find these values in the [Connect modal](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_?showConnect=true) under App Frameworks or in your project's [API settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/api).

- If you're using a local instance of Supabase, you can find these values by running `supabase start` or `supabase status` (if you already have it running).
