<BlockPreview name="social-auth/auth/login" />

<Callout className="mt-4">
  The block is using Github provider by default, but can be easily switched by changing a single
  parameter.
</Callout>

## Installation

<BlockItem name="social-auth-nextjs" description="All needed components for the social auth flow" />

## Folder structure

This block includes the [Supabase client](/ui/docs/nextjs/client). If you already have one installed, you can skip overwriting it.

<RegistryBlock itemName="social-auth-nextjs" />

## Usage

Once you install the block in your Next.js project, you'll get all the necessary pages and components to set up a social authentication flow.

### Getting started

First, add a `.env` file to your project with the following environment variables:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
```

- If you're using supabase.com, you can find these values in the [Connect modal](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_?showConnect=true) under App Frameworks or in your project's [API settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/api).

- If you're using a local instance of Supabase, you can find these values by running `supabase start` or `supabase status` (if you already have it running).

### Setting up third party providers

We support a wide variety of social providers that you can use to integrate with your application. The full list is available [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/social-login).
This block uses the PKCE flow with GitHub as the provider. To switch providers, just update the `provider` field in the `supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth` call. Enable the provider you want to use under [Auth Providers](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers) in the Supabase Dashboard and add the necessary credentials.

### Setting up routes and redirect URLs

1. Set the site URL in the [URL Configuration](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/url-configuration) settings in the Supabase Dashboard.
1. Update the redirect paths in `login-form.tsx` to point to your appâ€™s logged-in routes. Our examples use `/protected`, but you can set this to whatever fits your app.
1. Visit `http://your-site-url/auth/login` to see this component in action.

<Callout type="info">

You can use this block with the Pages router by simply moving the routes from the `app` folder into the `pages` folder and renaming them. Example instead of `app/login/page.tsx`, you'd create a `pages/login.tsx` file.

</Callout>

### Combining social auth with password-based auth

If you want to combine this block with the password-based auth, you need to:

- Copy the `handleSocialLogin` function into the password-based `login-form.tsx` component and bind it to a "Login with ..." button.
- Copy the `@/app/auth/oauth/route.ts` in your app under the same route.
