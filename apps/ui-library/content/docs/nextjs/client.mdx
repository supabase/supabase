## Installation

<BlockItem name="supabase-client-nextjs" description="Supabase Client for Next.js" />

## Folder structure

<RegistryBlock itemName="supabase-client-nextjs" />

## Usage

This block installs a Supabase client to be used by Next.js. It's meant to be used with app router and it's fully SSR compatible.

If you started a project through `npx create-next-app -e with-supabase` command, this block is already included in your project.

To get started, you need to add an `.env` file to your project with the following entries:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
```

If you're using a local instance of supabase, you can find these values by running `supabase start` or `supabase status` (if already running).

If you're using supabase.com project, you can find them in the [Connect modal](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_?showConnect=true) under App Frameworks or in your project's [API settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/api).
