## Usage

The `CurrentUserAvatar` component connects to Supabase Auth to fetch the user data and show an avatar. It uses the `user_metadata`
property which gets populated automatically by Supabase Auth if the user logged in via a provider. If the user doesn't have a profile image, it renders their initials. If the user is logged out, it renders a `?`.

The `CurrentUserAvatar` component integrates with Supabase Auth to display user avatars dynamically. It automatically retrieves the profile image from the `user_metadata` field, which Supabase Auth populates when using provider-based authentication. The component also fallbacks to `?` if the user is unauthenticated.
