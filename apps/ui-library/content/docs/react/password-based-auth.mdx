## Usage

After installing the block in your Nextjs project, you'll have all needed pages and components to build a password-based authentication flow.

There few more steps to finish the installation:

1. Set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` environment variables in your `.env` file in your project.
1. Add an [email template for sign-up](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/uznvnxvfhkixgqetwekc/auth/templates) to the Supabase project. For detailed instructions on how to configure your email
   templates, including the use of variables like `{{ .SiteURL }}`,`{{ .TokenHash }}`, and `{{ .RedirectTo }}`, refer to our [Email Templates guide](/docs/email-templates).

   Your signup email template should contain the following HTML:

   ```html
   <h2>Confirm your signup</h2>

   <p>Follow this link to confirm your user:</p>
   <p>
     <a
       href="{{ .SiteURL }}/auth/confirm?token_hash={{ .TokenHash }}&type=email&next={{ .RedirectTo }}"
       >Confirm your email</a
     >
   </p>
   ```

1. Set the site URL in the [Supabase dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/url-configuration).
1. Set the forgot-password route in `forgot-password-form.tsx` component. The route needs to be configured as a redirect URL in the [Supabase dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/url-configuration).
1. Update the redirect paths in the `login-form.tsx` and `update-password-form.tsx` components to point to the logged-in routes in your app.
