## Introduction

Uploading files should be easy—this component handles the tricky parts for you.

The File Upload component makes it easy to add file uploads to your app, with built-in support for drag-and-drop, file type restrictions, image previews, and configurable limits on file size and number of files. All the essentials, ready to go.

**Features**

- Drag-and-drop support
- Multiple file uploads
- File size and count limits
- Image previews for supported file types
- MIME type restrictions
- Invalid file handling
- Success and error states with clear feedback

## Usage

- Simply add this `<Dropzone />` component to your page and it will handle the rest.
- For control over file upload, you can pass in a `props` object to the component.

```tsx
import { Dropzone, DropzoneContent, DropzoneEmptyState } from '@/components/dropzone'
import { useSupabaseUpload } from '@/hooks/use-supabase-upload'

const FileUploadDemo = () => {
  const props = useSupabaseUpload({
    bucketName: 'test',
    path: 'test',
    allowedMimeTypes: ['image/*'],
    maxFiles: 2,
    maxFileSize: 1000 * 1000 * 10, // 10MB,
  })

  return (
    <div className="w-[500px]">
      <Dropzone {...props}>
        <DropzoneEmptyState />
        <DropzoneContent />
      </Dropzone>
    </div>
  )
}

export { FileUploadDemo }
```
