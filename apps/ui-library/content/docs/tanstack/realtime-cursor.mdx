## Introduction

The Realtime Cursors component lets users share their cursor position with others in the same roomâ€”perfect for real-time collaboration. It handles all the setup and boilerplate for you, so you can add it to your app with minimal effort.

**Features**

- Broadcast cursor position to other users in the same room
- Customizable cursor appearance
- Presence detection (automatically joins/leaves users)
- Low-latency updates using Supabase Realtime
- Room-based isolation for scoped collaboration

## Usage

The Realtime Cursor component is designed to be used in a room. It can be used to build real-time collaborative applications. Add the `<RealtimeCursors />` component to your page and it will render realtime cursors from other users in the room.

```tsx
import { RealtimeCursors } from '@/components/realtime-cursors'

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div className="w-full min-h-screen">
      <RealtimeCursors roomName="macrodata_refinement_office" username="Mark Scout" />
    </div>
  )
}
```
