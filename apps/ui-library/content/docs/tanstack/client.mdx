## Installation

<BlockItem name="supabase-client-tanstack" description="Supabase Client for TanStack Start" />

<TanStackBeta />

## Folder structure

<RegistryBlock itemName="supabase-client-tanstack" />

## Usage

This block installs Supabase clients for connecting your TanStack Start project to Supabase. They're designed for use in both server-side loaders and actions, as well as client-side components.

If you've already set up a Supabase client in your project, you can just continue using that existing setup.

### Getting started

First, add a `.env` file to your project with the following environment variables:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
```

- If you're using supabase.com, you can find these values in the [Connect modal](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_?showConnect=true) under App Frameworks or in your project's [API settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/api).

- If you're using a local instance of Supabase, you can find these values by running `supabase start` or `supabase status` (if you already have it running).
