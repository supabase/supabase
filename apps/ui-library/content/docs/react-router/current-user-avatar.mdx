## Introduction

The `CurrentUserAvatar` component connects to Supabase Auth to fetch the user data and show an avatar. It uses the `user_metadata`
property which gets populated automatically by Supabase Auth if the user logged in via a provider. If the user doesn't have a profile image, it renders their initials. If the user is logged out, it renders a `?` as a fallback, which you can change.

## Usage

The `CurrentUserAvatar` component is designed to be used anywhere in your app. Add the `<CurrentUserAvatar />` component to your page and it will render the avatar of the current user, with a fallback.

```tsx
import { CurrentUserAvatar } from '@/components/current-user-avatar'

const CurrentUserAvatarDemo = () => {
  return (
    <Header className="flex items-center justify-between">
      <h1>Lumon Industries</h1>
      <CurrentUserAvatar />
    </Header>
  )
}

export default CurrentUserAvatarDemo
```

## Props

This component doesn't accept any props. If you wish to change the fallback, you can do so by changing the `CurrentUserAvatar` component directly.
