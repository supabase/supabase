    <AccordionTrigger>How does it work? </AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      You run a command in a new or existing project that looks something like this:
      ```bash
      npx shadcn@latest add http://supabase.com/ui/r/password-based-auth-nextjs.json
      ```
        This will add all of the files to your project and install the dependencies.
      After you've run the command, you can start using the components. In the case of Auth, you should be up and running with user sign in/sign up with just this one command.

    <AccordionItem value="overwrite">
      <AccordionTrigger>Will it overwrite my existing files?</AccordionTrigger>
      <AccordionContent>
        No. If you run a command in an existing project, it will <u>not</u> overwrite your existing
        files. If there conflicting files, you will be asked what you want to do (leave them or
        overwrite them). If you run it in a new project, it will just add the new files to your project.

    <AccordionItem value="existing-project">
      <AccordionTrigger>I've already started my a project, what should I do?</AccordionTrigger>
      <AccordionContent>
        You can still use these components, even if you've already started your project! The commands
        won't overwrite your existing files, but you should still be careful with the changes to makes
        sure you understand what's been added. You should commit your changes into Git before running
        these commands so you'll be able to see a clean diff of the changes.

    <AccordionItem value="shadcn">
      <AccordionTrigger>I've already installed shadcn/ui, what should I do?</AccordionTrigger>
      <AccordionContent>
        You're off to a great start! You can now run an add command to add the desired component to your
        project.

    <AccordionItem value="quickstart">
      <AccordionTrigger>
        I already started with `npx create-next-app -e with-supabase` what should I do now?
      </AccordionTrigger>
      <AccordionContent>
        Our Next.js quickstart is a great starting point for building a full app with Supabase and
        Next.js. If you've already started with this template, you can use add command to add more
        components to your project.

    <AccordionItem value="ai-builder">
      <AccordionTrigger>I used an AI builder to build my app, what should I do?</AccordionTrigger>
      <AccordionContent>
        If your app is already built, you can use any of the commands to drop components into your
        project. Your app likely already has a Supabase client set up, so you can just continue using
        that if it's working well for you.
