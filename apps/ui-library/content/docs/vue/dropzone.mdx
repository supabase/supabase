**Features**

- Drag-and-drop support
- Multiple file uploads
- File size and count limits
- Image previews for supported file types
- MIME type restrictions
- Invalid file handling
- Success and error states with clear feedback

## Usage

- Simply add this `<Dropzone />` component to your page and it will handle the rest.

```html
<script setup>
  import { Dropzone, DropzoneEmptyState, DropzoneContent } from '@/components/dropzone'
  import { useSupabaseUpload } from '@/composables/use-supabase-upload'

  const upload = useSupabaseUpload({
    bucketName: 'test',
    path: 'test',
    allowedMimeTypes: ['image/*'],
    maxFiles: 2,
    maxFileSize: 1000 * 1000 * 10, // 10MB,
  })
</script>
