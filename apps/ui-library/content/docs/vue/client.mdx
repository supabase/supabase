## Installation

<BlockItem name="supabase-client-vue" description="Supabase Client for Vue SPA" />

## Folder structure

<RegistryBlock itemName="supabase-client-vue" />

## Usage

This block installs a Supabase client for connecting your Vue project to Supabase. It's designed for use in client-side components.

If you've already set up a Supabase client in your project, you can just continue using that existing setup.

### Getting started

After installing the block, you'll have the following environment variables in your `.env.local` file:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_OR_ANON_KEY=
```

- If you're using supabase.com, you can find these values in the [Connect modal](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_?showConnect=true&tab=frameworks&framework=vuejs&using=supabasejs) under App Frameworks or in your project's [API keys](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/api-keys).

- If you're using a local instance of Supabase, you can find these values by running `supabase start` or `supabase status` (if you already have it running).

You can use the client in your Vue component like following:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { onMounted, ref } from 'vue'

import { createClient } from './lib/supabase/client'

const profile = ref(null)

onMounted(async () => {
  const { data, error } = await createClient.from('profiles').select('*').single()

  if (!error) profile.value = data
})
</script>

<template>
  <div>
    {{ profile }}
  </div>
</template>
```
