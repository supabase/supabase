# Postgres SQL Style Guide

## General

- Use lowercase for SQL reserved words to maintain consistency and readability.
- Employ consistent, descriptive identifiers for tables, columns, and other database objects.
- Use white space and indentation to enhance the readability of your code.
- Store dates in ISO 8601 format (`yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.sssss`).
- Include comments for complex logic, using '/_ ... _/' for block comments and '--' for line comments.

## Naming Conventions

- Avoid SQL reserved words and ensure names are unique and under 63 characters.
- Use snake_case for tables and columns.
- Prefer plurals for table names
- Prefer singular names for columns.

## Tables

- Avoid prefixes like 'tbl\_' and ensure no table name matches any of its column names.
- Always add an `id` column of type `identity generated always` unless otherwise specified.
- Create all tables in the `public` schema unless otherwise specified.
- Always add the schema to SQL queries for clarity.
- Always add a comment to describe what the table does. The comment can be up to 1024 characters.

## Columns

- Use singular names and avoid generic names like 'id'.
- For references to foreign tables, use the singular of the table name with the `_id` suffix. For example `user_id` to reference the `users` table
- Always use lowercase except in cases involving acronyms or when readability would be enhanced by an exception.

#### Examples:

```sql
create table books (
  id bigint generated always as identity primary key,
  title text not null,
  author_id bigint references authors (id)
);
comment on table books is 'A list of all the books in the library.';
```

## Queries

- When the query is shorter keep it on just a few lines. As it gets larger start adding newlines for readability
- Add spaces for readability.

Smaller queries:

```sql
select *
from employees
where end_date is null;

update employees
set end_date = '2023-12-31'
where employee_id = 1001;
```

Larger queries:

```sql
select
  first_name,
  last_name
from employees
where start_date between '2021-01-01' and '2021-12-31' and status = 'employed';
```

### Joins and Subqueries

- Format joins and subqueries for clarity, aligning them with related SQL clauses.
- Prefer full table names when referencing tables. This helps for readability.

```sql
select
  employees.employee_name,
  departments.department_name
from
  employees
  join departments on employees.department_id = departments.department_id
where employees.start_date > '2022-01-01';
```

## Aliases

- Use meaningful aliases that reflect the data or transformation applied, and always include the 'as' keyword for clarity.

```sql
select count(*) as total_employees
from employees
where end_date is null;
```

## Complex queries and CTEs

- If a query is extremely complex, prefer a CTE.
- Make sure the CTE is clear and linear. Prefer readability over performance.
- Add comments to each block.

```sql
with
  department_employees as (
    -- Get all employees and their departments
    select
      employees.department_id,
      employees.first_name,
      employees.last_name,
      departments.department_name
    from
      employees
      join departments on employees.department_id = departments.department_id
  ),
  employee_counts as (
    -- Count how many employees in each department
    select
      department_name,
      count(*) as num_employees
    from department_employees
    group by department_name
  )
select
  department_name,
  num_employees
from employee_counts
order by department_name;
```
