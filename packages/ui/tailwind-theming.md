# Tailwind theming

Supabase is migrating to use tailwind classes that use CSS properties.
This is to support the concept of theming, so that:

1. It is easy for the team to update the theme without changing 100s of files.
2. We could offer custom or additional themes in future.

## Primitives

We (the Supabase Design team âœ¨) define primitive color values using Figma Variables.

- `foreground`
- `background`
- `border`
- `brand` (could become primary)
- `destructive`
- `warning`

These values are exported from Figma as a .json file and transformed into tailwind utilities through some scripts under `packages/ui/internals/tokens`.

Primitives work the same way as any other color. They should follow some basic usage patterns such as _foreground_ on text and _background_ on surfaces, but they can also be combined with any tailwind utility to achieve more advanced layouts.

For example, `foreground-light` can also be applied on borders and backgrounds as `border-foreground-light` and `bg-foreground-light`, if needed.

Similarly, background and border primitives can be used on other tailwind utilities.

```
border-surface-100
bg-border-overlay
text-background-surface-100
```

## Usage

The following tailwind classes are a combination of tailwind utilities and our primitives. They're under development and are likely to change but most are now in use and will probably be permanent fixtures.

### Foreground (Text)

| Value                  | Usage                                  |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `foreground-{DEFAULT}` | Default text (**DEFAULT** is optional) |
| `foreground-light`     | Light text                             |
| `foreground-lighter`   | Lighter text                           |
| `foreground-muted`     | Muted text                             |

Examples:

```
text-foreground
text-foreground-light
text-foreground-lighter
text-foreground-muted
bg-foreground-light
```

### Background

| Value                      | Usage                                                        |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `{background}-{DEFAULT}`   | Main body background (**DEFAULT** is optional)               |
| `{background}-surface-100` | Panels and surfaces on the same level of the main background |
| `{background}-surface-200` | Surfaces that overlap the main content (ex. drodowns)        |
| `{background}-surface-300` | Surfaces that are stacked above {background}-surface-200     |
| `{background}-alternative` | Alernative background (inverted)                             |
| `{background}-overlay`     | Overlays, Dropdowns, Popovers                                |
| `{background}-control`     | Inputs, Radios, Checkboxes                                   |

The `background` part can be omitted when used on the `bg` tailwind utility.

Examples:

```
bg-surface-100
bg-overlay
bg-alternative
text-background-surface-100
```
