Supabase is an **open source** company.

While we're in Beta we are free to use. In the future, we will charge for hosting. However, we are offering the following initiatives:

- All Alpha Users will receive credits equivalent of 2 years of base tier usage. These will automatically be credited to your account if you signed up prior to December 2020.
- All Beta Users (new users from December 2020) will receive 1 year of base tier usage for free.
- University (and participating code school) Students will be eligible for 2 years of base tier usage (Code Schools can contact rory@supabase.io)
- Early stage startups participating in selected incubator programs can claim additional credits which can be applied to products outside of the base tier.

The Supabase Base Tier constitutes a Supabase Instance running in a single region, on 2 vCPUs, 1 GiB Memory, with 2 GB of storage, and daily backups.
