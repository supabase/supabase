2. Add a new entry in `supabase/web/src/data/showcase.json` (you can replace and use the next one):
```
{
    "project_or_company": {
        "name": "Amazing project",
        "description": "This is an amazing description for an amazing project ðŸ˜„",
        "web_site": "my-powerful.site",
        "image": "img-name.extension"
    },
    "is_open_source": true/false,
    "public_repo": "my-repo"
}
```
3. Make a `pull request` to our [repository](https://github.com/supabase/supabase) labeled with... (@todo).
