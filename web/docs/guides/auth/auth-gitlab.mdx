Setting up GitLab logins for your application consists of 3 parts:

* Create and configure a GitLab Application on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com)
* Add your GitLab Application keys to your [Supabase Project](https://supabase.io)
* Add the login code to your [Supabase JS Client App](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js)

## Steps

### Log into your [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) Account

Once logged into *"GitLab"*:

### Create your GitLab Application

- Click on your profile logo (avatar) in the top-right corner
- Select Edit profile.
- In the left sidebar, select Applications.
- Enter your app information
  - Enter the name of the application
  - In the "Redirect URI" box, type the callback URL of your app.
    - Your "Redirect URI" ("Callback URL") looks like this:
      - `https://<project-ref>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
      - where `https://<project-ref>.supabase.co` is your Supabase Project API URL
          - Go to your [Supasebase Project Dashboard](https://supabase.io)
          - Click on the "Settings" icon at the bottom of the left sidebar
          - Click on "API" in the list
          - Under Config / URL you'll find your API URL, you can click "Copy" to copy it to the clipboard
          - Now just add "/auth/v1/callback" to the end of that to get your full "OAuth Redirect URI"
          - Enter this in the "Redirect URI" box
  - Check the box next to "Confidential" (make sure it is checked)
  - Check the scope named `read_user` (this is the only required scope)
  - Click "Save Application" at the bottom
  - Copy and save your "Application ID" (`client_id`) and "Secret" (`client_secret`) which you'll need later

### Enter your GitLab `client_id` and `client_secret` into your Supabase Project

- Go to your [Supasebase Project Dashboard](https://supabase.io)
- In the left sidebar, click the "Authentication" icon (near the top)
- Click "Settings" from the list to go to the "Authentication Settings" page
- Enter the final (hosted) URL of your app under "Site URL" (this is important)
- Under "External OAuth Providers" turn "GitLab Enabled" to ON
- Enter your `client_id` and `client_secret` saved in the previous step
- Click "Save"

### Add login code to your client app

The JavaScript client code is documented here: [Supabase OAuth Client Code](https://supabase.io/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signin#sign-in-using-third-party-providers)

```js
const { user, session, error } = await supabase.auth.signIn({
  provider: 'gitlab'
})
```

Just put this code in a function and create a button or a link or any other UI element to call the function.

```js
function signInWithGitLab() {
  const { user, session, error } = await supabase.auth.signIn({
    provider: 'gitlab'
  });
}
```

To log out:

```js
function signout() {
  const { error } = await supabase.auth.signOut();
}
```
