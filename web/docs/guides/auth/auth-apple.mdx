## Description

How to set up Apple Login ("Sign In With Apple")


The setup process consists of six parts:

* obtain an `App Id` with “Sign In with Apple” capabilities
* obtain a `Services Id` - this will serve as the `client_id`
* obtain a `secret key` that will be used to get our `client_secret`
* generate the `client_secret` using the `secret key`
* Add your `client id` and `client secret` keys to your [Supabase Project](https://supabase.io)
* Add the login code to your [Supabase JS Client App](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js)

## Steps

### Log into your [Apple Developer Account](https://developer.apple.com)

- Go to [https://developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com) 
- Click on `Account` at the top right to log in

Once logged into your *"Apple Deveoper Account"*:

### Obtain an App Id with “Sign In with Apple” capabilities.

- Go to Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles
- Click on "Identifiers" at the left
- Click on the + sign in the upper left next to “Identifiers”
- Select "App IDs" and click "Continue"
- Select type "App" and click "Continue"
- Fill out your app information
    - App description
    - Bundle ID (Apple recommends reverse-domain name style, so if your domain is acme.com and your app is called roadrunner, use: "com.acme.roadrunner")
    - Scroll down and check "Sign In With Apple"
    - Click "Contine" at the top right
    - Click "Register" at the top right

### Obtain a Services ID
This will serve as the `cliend_id` when you make API calls to authenticate the user.

- Go to Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles
- Click on "Identifiers" at the left
- Click on the + sign in the upper left next to “Identifiers”
- Select "Services IDs" and click "Continue"
- Fill out your information
    - App description
    - Bundle ID (you can't use the same Bundle ID from the previous step, but you can just add something to the beginning, such "app." to make it app.com.acme.roadrunner")
    - SAVE THIS ID -- this ID will become your "client_id" later    
    - Click "Contine" at the top right
    - Click "Register" at the top right

#### Configure your Services ID

- Under "Identifiers", click on your newly-created Services ID
- Check the box next to "Sign In With Apple" to enable it
- Click "Configure" to the right
- Make sure your newly created Bundle ID is selected under "Primary App ID"
- Add your domain to the "Domains and Subdomains" box (do not add https://, just add the domain)
- In the "Return URLs" box, type the callback URL of your app.
    - Your "Return URL" (OAuth Redirect URI) looks like this:
      - `https://<project-ref>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
      - where `https://<project-ref>.supabase.co` is your Supabase Project API URL
          - Go to your [Supasebase Project Dashboard](https://supabase.io)
          - Click on the "Settings" icon at the bottom of the left sidebar
          - Click on "API" in the list
          - Under Config / URL you'll find your API URL, you can click "Copy" to copy it to the clipboard
          - Now just add "/auth/v1/callback" to the end of that to get your full "OAauth Redirect URI"
          - Enter this in the "Return URLs" box
          - Click "Next" at the bottom right
- Click "Done" at the bottom
- Click "Contine" at the top right
- Click "Save" at the top right

### Download you secret key 
Now you'll need to download a "secret key" file from Apple that will be used to generate your `client_secret`.

- Go to "Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles"
- Click on "Keys" at the left
- Click on the + sign in the upper left next to "Keys"
- Enter a Key Name
- Check "Sign In with Apple"
- Click "Configure" to the right
- Select your newly-created Services ID from the dropdown selector
- Click "Save" at the top right
- Click "Continue" at the top right
- Click "Register" at the top right
- Click "Download" at the top right
- Save the downloaded file -- this contains your "secret key" that will be used to generate your `client_secret`
- Click "Done" at the top right

### Generate your `client_secret`
The "secret key" you downloaded is used to create the `client_secret` string you'll need to authenticate your users.

According to the [Apple Docs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/signinwithapplerestapi/generate_and_validate_tokens) it needs to be a JWT token encrypted using the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) with the P-256 curve and the SHA-256 hash algorithm.

At this time, the easiest way to generate this JWT token is with [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/).  If you don't have Ruby installed, you can [Download Ruby Here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads). 

- Install Ruby (or check to make sure it's installed on your system)
- Install [ruby-jwt](https://github.com/jwt/ruby-jwt)
    - From the command line, run: `sudo gem install jwt`

Create the script below using a text editor: `secret_gen.rb`

```ruby
require "jwt"

key_file = "Path to the private key"
team_id = "Your Team ID"
client_id = "The Service ID of the service you created"
key_id = "The Key ID of the private key"

validity_period = 180 # In days. Max 180 (6 months) according to Apple docs.

private_key = OpenSSL::PKey::EC.new IO.read key_file

token = JWT.encode(
	{
		iss: team_id,
		iat: Time.now.to_i,
		exp: Time.now.to_i + 86400 * validity_period,
		aud: "https://appleid.apple.com",
		sub: client_id
	},
	private_key,
	"ES256",
	header_fields=
	{
		kid: key_id 
	}
)
puts token
```

- Edit the `secret_gen.rb` file:
    - key_file = "Path to the private key you downloaded from Apple"
        - It should look like this: AuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8
    - team_id = "Your Team ID"
        - This is found at the top right of the Apple Developer site (next to your name)
    - client_id = "The Service ID of the service you created"
        - This is the "Services ID" you created in the above step "Obtain a Services ID"
        - If you've lost this ID, you can find it in the Apple Developer Site:
            - Go to "Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles"
            - Click "Identifiers" at the left
            - At the top right drop-down, select "Services IDs"
            - Find your Identifier in the list (i.e. app.com.acme.roadrunner)
    - key_id = "The Key ID of the private key"
        - This can be found in the name of your downloaded secret file (For a file named "AuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8" your key_id is "XXXXXXXXXX")
        - If you've lost this ID, you can find it in the Apple Developer Site:
            - Go to "Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles"
            - Click "Keys" at the left
            - Click on your newly-created key in the list
            - Look under "Key ID" to find your key_id
    - Once you've entered values for all 4 items (key_file, team_id, client_id, key_id) save the `secret_gen.rb` file
- Generate your `client_secret`
    - From the command line, run: `ruby secret_gen.rb > client_secret.txt`
    - Your `client_secret` is now stored in this `client_secret.txt` file

You should now have a `client_id` and `client_secret`


### Enter your Github Client ID and Client Secret into your Supabase Project

- Go to your [Supasebase Project Dashboard](https://supabase.io)
- In the left sidebar, click the "Authentication" icon (near the top)
- Click "Settings" from the list to go to the "Authentication Settings" page
- Enter the final (hosted) URL of your app under "Site URL" (this is important)
- Under "External OAuth Providers" turn "Apple Enabled" to ON
- Enter your `client_id` and `client_secret` saved in the previous steps
- Click "Save"

### Add login code to your client app

The JavaScript client code is documented here: [Supabase OAauth Client Code](https://supabase.io/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signin#sign-in-using-third-party-providers)

```js
const { user, session, error } = await supabase.auth.signIn({
  provider: 'apple'
})
```

Just put this code in a function and create a button or a link or any other UI element to call the function.

```js
function signInWithGithub() {
  const { user, session, error } = await supabase.auth.signIn({
    provider: 'apple'
  });
}
```

To log out:

```js
function signout() {
  const { error } = await supabase.auth.signOut();
}
```
