## Description

How to set up Facebook Login

The setup process consists of three parts:

* Create and configure a Facebook Application on the [Facebook Devalopers Site](https://developers.facebook.com)
* Add your Facebook keys to your [Supabase Project](https://supabase.io)
* Add the login code to your [Supabase JS Client App](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js)

## Steps

### Create a Facebook Developer Account

First, you'll need a Developer Account at [https://developers.facebook.com](https://developers.facebook.com).

### Create a Facebook App

Once logged into *"Facebook for Developers"*:

- Click on "My Apps" at the top right.
- Click "Create App" near the top right.
- Select your app type and click "Continue".
- Fill in your app information, then click "Create App".
- This should bring you to the screen: "Add Products to Your App". (Alternatively you can click on "Add Product" in the left sidebar to get to this screen.)

### Set up FaceBook Login for your Facebook App

From the "Add Products to your App" screen:

- Click "Setup" under "Facebook Login"
- Skip the Quickstart screen, instead, in the left sidebar, click "Settings" under "Facebook Login"
- Enter your callback URI under "Valid OAuth Redirect URIs" on the "Facebook Login Settings" page
    - Your OAuth Redirect URI looks like this:
      - `https://<project-ref>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
      - where `https://<project-ref>.supabase.co` is your Supabase Project API URL
          - Go to your [Supasebase Project Dashboard](https://supabase.io)
          - Click on the "Settings" icon at the bottom of the left sidebar
          - Click on "API" in the list
          - Under Config / URL you'll find your API URL, you can click "Copy" to copy it to the clipboard
          - Now just add "/auth/v1/callback" to the end of that to get your full "OAauth Redirect URI"
          - Enter this in the "Valid OAuth Redirect URIs" box
          - Click "Save Changes" at the bottom right

### Copy your Facebook App ID and Secret

- Click "Settings / Basic" in the left sidebar
- Copy your App ID from the top of the "Basic Settings" page 
- Under "App Secret" click "Show" then copy your secret 
- Make sure all required fields are completed on this screen.

### Enter your Facebook App ID and Secret into your Supabase Project

- Go to your [Supasebase Project Dashboard](https://supabase.io)
- In the left sidebar, click the "Authentication" icon (near the top)
- Click "Settings" from the list to go to the "Authentication Settings" page
- Enter the final (hosted) URL of your app under "Site URL" (this is important)
- Under "External OAuth Providers" turn "Facebook Enabled" to ON
- Enter your "Facebook client ID" and "Facebook secret" saved in the previous step
- Click "Save"

### Add login code to your client app

The JavaScript client code is documented here: [Supabase OAauth Client Code](https://supabase.io/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signin#sign-in-using-third-party-providers)

```js
const { user, session, error } = await supabase.auth.signIn({
  provider: 'facebook'
})
```

Just put this code in a function and create a button or a link or any other UI element to call the function.

```js
function signInWithFacebook() {
  const { user, session, error } = await supabase.auth.signIn({
    provider: 'facebook'
  });
}
```

To log out:

```js
function signout() {
  const { error } = await supabase.auth.signOut();
}
```
