To enable WorkOS Auth for your project, you need to set up WorkOS OAuth application and add the application credentials to your Supabase Dashboard.

## Overview

WorkOS OAuth consists of four broad steps:

- Create a new organization from your WorkOS Dashboard.
- Obtain the `Client ID` from the Configuration tab and configure redirect URI.
- Obtain the `WorkOS Secret` from the credentials tab.
- Add your WorkOS credentials into your Supabase project
## Steps

### Create a WorkOS Organization

Log in to the dashboard and hop over to the Organizations tab to create and organization

### Obtain the Client ID and configure Redirect URI

Head over to the Configuration tab and configure the redirect URI.The redirect URI should look like `https://<project-ref>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`

### Add your WorkOS credentials into your Supabase Project

- Go to your [Supabase Project Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com)
- In the left sidebar, click the `Authentication` icon (near the top)
- Click `Settings` from the list to go to the `Authentication Settings` page
- Under `External OAuth Providers` turn `WorkOS Enabled` to ON
- Enter the `Client ID`, `Secret`, and `WorkOS URL` saved in the previous steps
- Click `Save`

### Add login code to your client app

The JavaScript client code is documented in the [Supabase OAuth Reference](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signin#sign-in-using-third-party-providers).

```js
const { user, session, error } = await supabase.auth.signIn({
  provider: 'workos',
})
```

Add a function which you can call from a button, link, or UI element.

```js
async function signInWithWorkOS() {
  const { user, session, error } = await supabase.auth.signIn({
    provider: 'workos',
  }
}
```

To log out:

```js
async function signout() {
  const { error } = await supabase.auth.signOut()
}
```
