To enable WorkOS Auth for your project, you need to set up WorkOS OAuth application and add the application credentials to your Supabase Dashboard.

## Overview

WorkOS OAuth consists of five broad steps:

- Create a new client in your specified workos organization.
- Ensure that the new client has the "Client Protocol" set to "openid-connect" and the "Access Type" is set to "confidential".
- The `Client ID` of the client created will be used as the `client id`.
- Obtain the `Secret` from the credentials tab which will be used as the `client secret`.
- Whitelist the callback url of your application.

## Steps

### Access your WorkOS Admin console

### Create a WorkOS Client

The "Client ID" of the created client will serve as the `client_id` when you make API calls to authenticate the user.

### Client Settings

After you've created the client successfully, ensure that you set the following settings:

1. The "Client Protocol" should be set to "openid-connect".
2. The "Access Type" should be set to "confidential".
3. The "Valid Redirect URIs" should be set to: `https://<project-ref>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`.

### Obtain the Client Secret

This will serve as the `client_secret` when you make API calls to authenticate the user.
Under the "Credentials" tab, the `Secret` value will be used as the `client secret`.

### Add login code to your client app

The JavaScript client code is documented in the [Supabase OAuth Reference](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signin#sign-in-using-third-party-providers).

```js
const { user, session, error } = await supabase.auth.signIn({
  provider: 'workos',
})
```

Add a function which you can call from a button, link, or UI element.

```js
async function signInWithWorkOS() {
  const { user, session, error } = await supabase.auth.signIn({
    provider: 'workos',
  }
}
```

To log out:

```js
async function signout() {
  const { error } = await supabase.auth.signOut()
}
```
