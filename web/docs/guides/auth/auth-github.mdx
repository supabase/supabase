Setting up Github logins for your application consists of 3 parts:

* Create and configure a Github OAuth App on [Github](https://github.com)
* Add your Github OAuth keys to your [Supabase Project](https://supabase.io)
* Add the login code to your [Supabase JS Client App](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js)

## Steps

### Log into your [Github](https://github.com) Account

Once logged into *"Github"*:

Go to the [Github Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers) page:

- Click on your profile photo at the top right
- Click Settings near the bottom of the menu
- In the left sidebar, click "Developer settings" (near the bottom)
- In the left sidebar, click "OAuth Apps"

Register a new OAuth application

- Click "Register a new application"
  - (If you've created an app before, click "New OAuth App" here)
- In "Application name", type the name of your app.
- In "Homepage URL", type the full URL to your app's website.
- In "Authorization callback URL", type the callback URL of your app.
    - Your OAuth Redirect URI looks like this:
      - `https://<project-ref>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
      - where `https://<project-ref>.supabase.co` is your Supabase Project API URL
          - Go to your [Supasebase Project Dashboard](https://supabase.io)
          - Click on the "Settings" icon at the bottom of the left sidebar
          - Click on "API" in the list
          - Under Config / URL you'll find your API URL, you can click "Copy" to copy it to the clipboard
          - Now just add "/auth/v1/callback" to the end of that to get your full "OAuth Redirect URI"
          - Enter this in the "Valid OAuth Redirect URIs" box
          - Click "Save Changes" at the bottom right
- Click "Register Application"

Copy your new OAuth credentials

- Copy and save your "Client ID"
- Click "Generate a new client secret"
- Copy and save your "Client secret"

### Enter your Github Client ID and Client Secret into your Supabase Project

- Go to your [Supasebase Project Dashboard](https://supabase.io)
- In the left sidebar, click the "Authentication" icon (near the top)
- Click "Settings" from the list to go to the "Authentication Settings" page
- Enter the final (hosted) URL of your app under "Site URL" (this is important)
- Under "External OAuth Providers" turn "Github Enabled" to ON
- Enter your "Github Client ID" and "Github Client Secret" saved in the previous step
- Click "Save"

### Add login code to your client app

The JavaScript client code is documented here: [Supabase OAuth Client Code](https://supabase.io/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signin#sign-in-using-third-party-providers)

```js
const { user, session, error } = await supabase.auth.signIn({
  provider: 'github'
})
```

Add this function which you can call from a button, link, or UI element.

```js
function signInWithGithub() {
  const { user, session, error } = await supabase.auth.signIn({
    provider: 'github'
  });
}
```

To log out:

```js
function signout() {
  const { error } = await supabase.auth.signOut();
}
```
