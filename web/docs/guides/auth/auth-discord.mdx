To enable Discord Auth for your project, you need to set up a Discord Application and add the Application OAuth credentials to your Supabase Dashboard.

## Overview

Setting up Discord logins for your application consists of 3 parts:

* Create and configure a Discord Application [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers)
* Add your Discord OAuth Consumer keys to your [Supabase Project](https://supabase.io)
* Add the login code to your [Supabase JS Client App](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js)

## Steps

### Access your Discord account

- Go to [discord.com](https://discord.com/).
- Click on `Login` at the top right to log in.

### Find your callback URL

In the next step you require a callback URL, which looks like this: 

`https://<project-ref>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`

- Go to your [Supabase Project Dashboard](https://supabase.io).
- Click on the `Settings` icon at the bottom of the left sidebar.
- Click on `API` in the list.
- Under Config / URL you'll find your API URL, you can click `Copy` to copy it to the clipboard.
- Now just add `/auth/v1/callback` to the end of that to get your full `OAuth Redirect URI`.

### Create a Discord Application

- Click on `New Application` at the top right.
- Enter the name of your application and click `Create`.
- Click on `OAuth2` under `Settings` in the left side panel.
- Click `Add Redirect` under `Redirects`.
- Type or paste your `callback URL` into the `Redirects` box.
- Click `Save Changes` at the bottom.
- Copy your `Client ID` and `Client Secret` under `Client information`.

### Add your Discord credentials into your Supabase Project

- Go to your [Supabase Project Dashboard](https://supabase.io)
- In the left sidebar, click the `Authentication` icon (near the top)
- Click `Settings` from the list to go to the `Authentication Settings` page
- Enter the final (hosted) URL of your app under `Site URL` (this is important)
- Under `External OAuth Providers` turn `Discord Enabled` to ON
- Enter your `client_id` and `client_secret` saved in the previous step
- Click `Save`

### Add login code to your client app

The JavaScript client code is documented here: [Supabase OAuth Client Code](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signin#sign-in-using-third-party-providers)

```js
const { user, session, error } = await supabase.auth.signIn({
  provider: 'discord'
})
```

Add this function which you can call from a button, link, or UI element.

```js
async function signInWithDiscord() {
  const { user, session, error } = await supabase.auth.signIn({
    provider: 'discord'
  });
}
```

To log out:

```js
async function signout() {
  const { error } = await supabase.auth.signOut();
}
```
