### Setting up Google Login

## Description

Adding a Google Login button to your application is easy if you follow these steps.

The setup process consists of three parts:

* Create and configure a Google Project on the [Google Cloud Platform Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard)
* Add your Google OAuth keys to your [Supabase Project](https://supabase.io)
* Add the login code to your [Supabase JS Client App](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js)

## Environment

* [Supabase JS Client](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js)
* [Supabase Dashboard (UI)](https://supabase.io)
* [Google Cloud Platform Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard)

## Requirements
* Supabase account (Free Tier OK)
* Any existing Supabase Project
* Javascript-based client application (Angular, React, Vue, etc.)

## Steps

### Create a Google Cloud Platform Account

First, you'll need an Account at [Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard).

### Create a Google Cloud Platform Project

Once logged into *"Google Cloud Platform"*:

- Click on "Select a Project" at the top left.
  - (Or, if a project is currently selected, click on the current project name at the top left.)
- Click "New Project" at the top right.
- Fill in your app information, then click "Create".
  - (This can take a few minutes.)
- This should bring you to the dashboard for your new project.

### Create the OAauth Keys for your project

From your project's dashboard screen:

- In the search bar at the top labelled "Search products and resources" type "OAuth"
- Click on "OAauth consent screen" from the list of results
- On the "OAauth consent screen" page select "External"
- Click "Create"

Edit your app information

- On the "Edit app registration" page fill out your app information
- Click "Save and continue" at the bottom

Create your credentials

- Click "Credentials" at the left to go to the "Credentials" page
- Click "Create Credentials" near the top then select "OAauth client ID"
- On the "Create OAuth client ID" page, select your application type.  If you're not sure, choose "Web application".
- Fill in your app name
- At the bottom, under "Authorised redirect URIs" click "Add URI"
- Enter your callback URI under "Authorised redirect URIs" at the bottom
    - Your OAuth Redirect URI looks like this:
      - https://xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback
      - where https://xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.supabase.co is your Supabase Project API URL
          - Go to your [Supasebase Project Dashboard](https://supabase.io)
          - Click on the "Settings" icon at the bottom of the left sidebar
          - Click on "API" in the list
          - Under Config / URL you'll find your API URL, you can click "Copy" to copy it to the clipboard
          - Now just add "/auth/v1/callback" to the end of that to get your full "OAauth Redirect URI"
          - Enter this in the "Valid OAuth Redirect URIs" box
          - Click "Save Changes" at the bottom right
- Click "Create"

Copy your new OAuth credentials

- A box will appear called "OAuth client created"
- Copy and save the values under "Your Client ID" and "Your Client Secret"


### Enter your Google Client ID and Client Secret into your Supabase Project

- Go to your [Supasebase Project Dashboard](https://supabase.io)
- In the left sidebar, click the "Authentication" icon (near the top)
- Click "Settings" from the list to go to the "Authentication Settings" page
- Enter the final (hosted) URL of your app under "Site URL" (this is important)
- Under "External OAuth Providers" turn "Google Enabled" to ON
- Enter your "Google Client ID" and "Google Client Secret" saved in the previous step
- Click "Save"

### Add login code to your client app

The JavaScript client code is documented here: [Supabase OAauth Client Code](https://supabase.io/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signin#sign-in-using-third-party-providers)

```js
const { user, session, error } = await supabase.auth.signIn({
  provider: 'google'
})
```

Just put this code in a function and create a button or a link or any other UI element to call the function.

```js
function signInWithGoogle() {
  const { user, session, error } = await supabase.auth.signIn({
    provider: 'google'
  });
}
```

To log out:

```js
function signout() {
  const { error } = await supabase.auth.signOut();
}
```
