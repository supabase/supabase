To enable Google Auth for your project, you need to set up a Google OAuth application and add the application credentials to your Supabase Dashboard.

## Overview

Setting up Google logins for your application consists of 3 parts:

* Create and configure a Google Project on the [Google Cloud Platform Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard)
* Add your Google OAuth keys to your [Supabase Project](https://supabase.io)
* Add the login code to your [Supabase JS Client App](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js)

## Steps

### Access your Google Cloud Platform account

- Go to [cloud.google.com](https://cloud.google.com).
- Click on `Sign in` at the top right to log in.

### Create a Google Cloud Platform Project

- Click on `Select a Project` at the top left.
  - (Or, if a project is currently selected, click on the current project name at the top left.)
- Click `New Project` at the top right.
- Fill in your app information, then click `Create`.
  - (This can take a few minutes.)
- This should bring you to the dashboard for your new project.

### Create the OAuth Keys for your project

From your project's dashboard screen:

- In the search bar at the top labelled `Search products and resources` type `OAuth`.
- Click on `OAuth consent screen` from the list of results.
- On the `OAuth consent screen` page select `External`.
- Click `Create`.

### Edit your app information

- On the `Edit app registration` page fill out your app information.
- Click `Save and continue` at the bottom.

### Find your callback URL

The next step requires a callback URL, which looks like this: 

`https://<project-ref>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`

- Go to your [Supabase Project Dashboard](https://supabase.io).
- Click on the `Settings` icon at the bottom of the left sidebar.
- Click on `API` in the list.
- Under Config / URL you'll find your API URL, you can click `Copy` to copy it to the clipboard.
- Now just add `/auth/v1/callback` to the end of that to get your full `OAuth Redirect URI`.

### Create your credentials

- Click `Credentials` at the left to go to the `Credentials` page
- Click `Create Credentials` near the top then select `OAuth client ID`
- On the `Create OAuth client ID` page, select your application type.  If you're not sure, choose `Web application`.
- Fill in your app name.
- At the bottom, under `Authorized redirect URIs` click `Add URI`.
- Enter your callback URI under `Authorized redirect URIs` at the bottom.
- Enter your callback URI in the `Valid OAuth Redirect URIs` box.
- Click `Save Changes` at the bottom right.
- Click `Create`.

Copy your new OAuth credentials

- A box will appear called `OAuth client created`.
- Copy and save the values under `Your Client ID` and `Your Client Secret`.


### Enter your Google credentials into your Supabase Project

- Go to your [Supabase Project Dashboard](https://supabase.io)
- In the left sidebar, click the `Authentication` icon (near the top)
- Click `Settings` from the list to go to the `Authentication Settings` page
- Enter the final (hosted) URL of your app under `Site URL` (this is important)
- Under `External OAuth Providers` turn `Google Enabled` to ON
- Enter your `Google Client ID` and `Google Client Secret` saved in the previous step
- Click `Save`

### Add login code to your client app

The JavaScript client code is documented here: [Supabase OAuth Client Code](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signin#sign-in-using-third-party-providers)

```js
const { user, session, error } = await supabase.auth.signIn({
  provider: 'google'
})
```

Add this function which you can call from a button, link, or UI element.

```js
async function signInWithGoogle() {
  const { user, session, error } = await supabase.auth.signIn({
    provider: 'google'
  });
}
```

To log out:

```js
async function signout() {
  const { error } = await supabase.auth.signOut();
}
```
