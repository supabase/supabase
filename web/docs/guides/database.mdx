Supabase is built on top of [Postgres](/docs/postgres/server/about), an extremely scalable Relational Database.

## Features

### Table View 

You don't have to be a database expert to start using Supabase. Our table view makes Postgres as easy to use as a spreadsheet.

### Additional features

- Supabase extends Postgres with realtime functionality using our [Realtime Server](/docs/realtime/server/about).
- Every project is a full Postgres database, with `postgres` level access.
- Managed backups - Supabase handles all your database backups.
- Data imports - import directly from a CSV or excel spreadsheet.


## Tips


### Changing the timezone of your server.

Your database is initialized with the UTC timezone. We recommend keeping it this way, as it is helpful for time calculation. 
If, however, you want to update the timezone, you can do so using any of the [database timezones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).

For example:

```sql
alter database postgres set timezone to 'Asia/Singapore';
```
