description: How to use configure and deploy Supabase.
---

Supabase is a [Hosted Platform](https://app.supabase.io), so you don't _have_ to deploy it yourself. 
However, if you want to configure and deploy it yourself, that's also possible.

## Before you begin

The self-hosted version of Supabase does not include a UI yet. 
We are working on this in stages, starting with our [UI library](https://github.com/supabase/ui) and with a [WIP PR here](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/pull/2281). 
[[more context](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/discussions/1001#discussioncomment-558696)]

In the meantime, here are some suggestions for working with your Postgres Database:

- `pgadmin`: https://www.pgadmin.org 
- `dbeaver`: https://dbeaver.com 
- `BeeKeeper`: https://beekeeperstudio.io
- `HeidiSQL`: https://heidisql.com
- `Table Plus`: https://www.tableplus.io

## Get the Docker Compose

We provide a Docker Compose directory which is includes all of the tools required for building on top of Supabase. 

You can download the Docker files in various ways:

### Option 1: Using our CLI 

Make sure the CLI is installed:

```bash
npm install -g supabase
```

Then run in any folder to create a `docker` folder with a `docker-compose.yml`:

```bash
supabase eject
```

### Option 2: Clone our repo

```bash
# 1. Copy an empty repo
git clone https://github.com/supabase/supabase

# 2. Move into the empty repo
cd supabase/docker
```

## Running Locally

Now that you have the Docker set up on your local machine, you can start it here by running 

```bash
docker-compose up
```

## Deploying

### Configuring each service

Supabase is made up of several services. We have prefilled the `docker-compose` file with all the configuration you need to get started. 
If you would like to change any of the configuration, you can update the env variables in the `docker-compose` file.

Here are a list of environment variables for each service:

- [Postgres](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/)
- [PostgREST](https://postgrest.org/en/v7.0.0/configuration.html)
- [Realtime](https://github.com/supabase/realtime#server-set-up)
- [GoTrue](https://github.com/supabase/gotrue)
- [Storage](https://github.com/supabase/storage-api)
- [Kong](https://docs.konghq.com/install/docker/)

### Update secrets 

If you are deploying to production, you should update the default [passwords and secrets](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/master/docker/.env).

### Update API keys 

All config for the API Gateway is stored in the `kong` directory. Inside `kong.yml` you'll find the routing for all services, the routing rules, 
and down the bottom you'll find the JWTs capable of accessing services that require API Key access.

See the full docs [here](https://docs.konghq.com/hub/kong-inc/key-auth/).

If you are deploying to production, you should encode a new `anon` and `service_role` API key and update 
them [here](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/b1e99d2ce1f63ba728230fb53a6de444f60bce1f/docker/dockerfiles/kong/kong.yml#L42). 

After you have regenerated the JWT secret in the step above, use a JWT generator (for example, using [jsonwebtoken.io](https://www.jsonwebtoken.io/)) to regenerate the API Keys using the payloads below:


```bash
# anon Payload:
{
 "iss": "supabase",
 "iat": 1603968834,
 "exp": 2550653634,
 "aud": "",
 "sub": "",
 "role": "anon"
}
# service_role Payload:
{
 "iss": "supabase",
 "iat": 1603968834,
 "exp": 2550653634,
 "aud": "",
 "sub": "",
 "role": "service_role"
}
```

### Configuring email 

GoTrue requires an SMTP server to send emails for all authentication actions. 
You will need to provide the following [settings](https://github.com/supabase/gotrue#e-mail) inside the `.env` file [here](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/027e7f7b97bbe7365db4f7f46abe480e05841006/docker/.env#L8).
