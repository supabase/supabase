description: How to use configure and deploy Supabase.
---

Supabase is a [Hosted Platform](https://app.supabase.io), so you don't _have_ to deploy it yourself. 
However, if you want to configure and deploy it yourself, that's also possible.

## Before you begin

The self-hosted version of Supabase does not include a UI yet. 
We are working on this in stages, starting with our [UI library](https://github.com/supabase/ui) and with a [WIP PR here](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/pull/2281). 
[[more context](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/discussions/1001#discussioncomment-558696)]

In the meantime, here are some suggestions for working with your Postgres Database:

- `pgadmin`: https://www.pgadmin.org 
- `dbeaver`: https://dbeaver.com 
- `BeeKeeper`: https://beekeeperstudio.io
- `HeidiSQL`: https://heidisql.com
- `Table Plus`: https://www.tableplus.io

## Set up Supabase Docker

We provide a Docker Compose setup for self-hosting Supabase. Follow the steps [here](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/tree/master/docker) to get started.

## Deploying

See the following guides to deploy Docker Compose setup using your preferred tool and platform:
