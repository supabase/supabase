You can develop an application either locally and deploy to a service of your choice, or using our hosted platform.

## Local development 

Local development (will be released 1 April). Our CLI makes heavy use of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), so make sure it is installed and configured on your machine before starting.

### Install our CLI

```bash
npm install -g supabase
```

### Initialize your project 

```bash
supabase init 
```

This command will create a `.supabase` folder which holds all the configuration for developing your project locally.

### Start  

```bash
supabase start 
```

This command uses Docker Compose to start all the services that make up Supabase. You can find the full Docker Compose [in our repo](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/master/docker). 

### Stop  

```bash
supabase stop 
```

## Self hosting

Every Supabase project is an amalgamation of open source tools. We provide a [Docker Compose](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/master/docker) setup which makes it simple to get started.


### Get the Docker Compose


You can download this Docker set up to your local machine in various ways:

#### Using our CLI (will be released 1 April).

```bash
supabase eject
```

Run this in any folder to create a `docker` folder with a `docker-compose.yml`

#### Clone our repo

```bash
# 1. Copy an empty repo
git clone https://github.com/supabase/supabase

# 2. Move into the empty repo
cd supabase/docker
```

#### Using a shallow clone

If you use Git version >2.25, you can use a shallow clone to download this folder to your local machine:

```bash
# 1. Copy an empty repo
git clone --no-checkout https://github.com/supabase/supabase

# 2. Move into the empty repo
cd supabase

# 3. Initialize sparse-checkout
git sparse-checkout init --cone

#4. Checkout the folder
git sparse-checkout set docker
```

### Running Supabase

Now that you have the Docker set up on your local machine, you can start it here by running 

```bash
docker-compose up
```

### Configuring each service

Supabase is made up of several services. We have prefilled the `docker-compose` file with all the configuration you need to get started. 
If you would like to change any of the configuration, you can update the env variables in the `docker-compose` file.

Here are a list of environment variables for each service:

- [Postgres](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/)
- [PostgREST](https://postgrest.org/en/v7.0.0/configuration.html)
- [Realtime](https://github.com/supabase/realtime#server-set-up)
- [GoTrue](https://github.com/supabase/gotrue)
- [Kong](https://docs.konghq.com/install/docker/)
