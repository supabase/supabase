description: How to use configure and deploy Supabase.
---

Supabase is a [Hosted Platform](https://app.supabase.io), so you don't _have_ to deploy it yourself. 
However, if you _want_ to configure and deploy it yourself, this is also possible.

## Before you begin

If you are about to step through this Guide, please record your steps! You can help us improve by adding 
missing details and fixing errors.

The self-hosted version of Supabase does not include a UI yet. 
We are working on this in stages, starting with our [UI library](https://github.com/supabase/ui) 
([more context](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/discussions/1001#discussioncomment-558696)).

In the meantime, here are some suggested tools for interacting with your Postgres Database:

- `pgadmin`: https://www.pgadmin.org 
- `dbeaver`: https://dbeaver.com 
- `BeeKeeper`: https://beekeeperstudio.io
- `HeidiSQL`: https://heidisql.com
- `Table Plus`: https://www.tableplus.io

## Get the Docker Compose

We provide a Docker Compose directory which is includes all of the tools required for building on top of Supabase. 

You can download the Docker files in various ways:

### Option 1: Using our CLI 

Make sure the CLI is installed:

```bash
npm install -g supabase
```

Then run in any folder to create a `docker` folder with a `docker-compose.yml`:

```bash
supabase eject
```

### Option 2: Clone our repo

```bash
# 1. Copy an empty repo
git clone https://github.com/supabase/supabase

# 2. Move into the empty repo
cd supabase/docker
```

### Option 3: Using a shallow clone

If you use Git version >2.25, you can use a shallow clone to download this folder to your local machine:

```bash
# 1. Copy an empty repo
git clone --no-checkout https://github.com/supabase/supabase

# 2. Move into the empty repo
cd supabase

# 3. Initialize sparse-checkout
git sparse-checkout init --cone

# 4. Checkout the folder
git sparse-checkout set docker
```

## Running Supabase

Now that you have the Docker set up on your local machine, you can start it here by running 

```bash
docker-compose up
```

**Important** 

Make sure you update the default passwords and secrets before running in Production:

- Postgres 
  - [POSTGRES_PASSWORD](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/blob/3efd909fe86dd3540195b85054b611f3aa1d0de6/docker/docker-compose.yml#L80)

## Configuring each service

Supabase is made up of several services. We have prefilled the `docker-compose` file with all the configuration you need to get started. 
If you would like to change any of the configuration, you can update the env variables in the `docker-compose` file.

Here are a list of environment variables for each service:

- [Postgres](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/)
- [PostgREST](https://postgrest.org/en/v7.0.0/configuration.html)
- [Realtime](https://github.com/supabase/realtime#server-set-up)
- [GoTrue](https://github.com/supabase/gotrue)
- [Kong](https://docs.konghq.com/install/docker/)

### Configuring email 

GoTrue requires an SMTP server to send emails for all authentication actions. 
You will need to provide the following [settings](https://github.com/supabase/gotrue#e-mail) inside the `docker-compose.yml` under `services.auth.environment`:

- `GOTRUE_SMTP_HOST` - The mail server hostname to send emails through.
- `GOTRUE_SMTP_PORT` - The port number to connect to the mail server on.
- `GOTRUE_SMTP_USER` - If the mail server requires authentication, the username to use.
- `GOTRUE_SMTP_PASS` - If the mail server requires authentication, the password to use.

### API Keys 

All config for the API Gateway is stored in the `kong` directory. Inside `kong.yml` you'll find the routing for all services, the routing rules, 
and down the bottom you'll find the JWTs capable of accessing services that require API Key access.

See the full docs [here](https://docs.konghq.com/hub/kong-inc/key-auth/).
