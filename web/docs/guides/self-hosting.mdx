description: How to use configure and deploy Supabase.
---

Supabase is a [Hosted Platform](https://app.supabase.io), so you don't _have_ to deploy it yourself. 
However, if you _want_ to configure and deploy it yourself, this is also possible.



## Get the Docker Compose

You can download this Docker set up to your local machine in various ways:

### Option 1: Using our CLI 

Make sure the CLI is installed:

```bash
npm install -g supabase
```

Then run in any folder to create a `docker` folder with a `docker-compose.yml`:

```bash
supabase eject
```

### Option 2: Clone our repo

```bash
# 1. Copy an empty repo
git clone https://github.com/supabase/supabase

# 2. Move into the empty repo
cd supabase/docker
```

### Option 3: Using a shallow clone

If you use Git version >2.25, you can use a shallow clone to download this folder to your local machine:

```bash
# 1. Copy an empty repo
git clone --no-checkout https://github.com/supabase/supabase

# 2. Move into the empty repo
cd supabase

# 3. Initialize sparse-checkout
git sparse-checkout init --cone

# 4. Checkout the folder
git sparse-checkout set docker
```

### Running Supabase

Now that you have the Docker set up on your local machine, you can start it here by running 

```bash
docker-compose up
```

### Configuring each service

Supabase is made up of several services. We have prefilled the `docker-compose` file with all the configuration you need to get started. 
If you would like to change any of the configuration, you can update the env variables in the `docker-compose` file.

Here are a list of environment variables for each service:

- [Postgres](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/)
- [PostgREST](https://postgrest.org/en/v7.0.0/configuration.html)
- [Realtime](https://github.com/supabase/realtime#server-set-up)
- [GoTrue](https://github.com/supabase/gotrue)
- [Kong](https://docs.konghq.com/install/docker/)
