Docker is the easiest way to get started with self-hosted Supabase.

## Before you begin

You need the following installed in your system:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and docker-compose
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Quick Start

### Get the code

Checkout the docker directory in the Supabase repo:

```sh
# Get the code
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/supabase/supabase

# Go to the docker folder
cd supabase/docker

# Copy the fake env vars
cp .env.example .env

# Start
docker-compose up
```

Now visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to start using Supabase Studio.


## Securing your setup

While we provided you with some example secrets for getting started, you should NEVER deploy your Supabase setup using the defaults we have provided.

Please follow these steps to secure your Docker setup. We [strongly recommend](/docs/guides/hosting/overview#managing-your-secrets) using a secrets manager when deploying to production.

### Generate API Keys

Use your `JWT_SECRET` to generate a `anon` and `service` API keys using the [JWT generator](/docs/guides/hosting/overview#api-keys).

Replace the values in these files:

- `.env`: 
  - `ANON_KEY` - replace with an `anon` key
  - `SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - replace with a `service` key
- `volumes/api/kong.yml`
  - `anon` - replace with an `anon` key
  - `service_role` - replace with a `service` key

### Update Secrets

Update the `.env` file with your own secrets. In particular, these are required:

- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: the password for the `postgres` role. 
- `JWT_SECRET`: used by PostgREST and GoTrue, among others.
- `SITE_URL`: the base URL of your site.
- `SMTP_*`: mail server credentials. You can use any SMTP server.


### Securing the Dashboard

The Docker setup doesn't include a management database for managing users and logins. If you plan to deploy the Studio to the web we suggest you put it behind a web proxy with Basic Auth or hide it behind a VPN. 

## Configuration

To keep the setup simple, we made some choices that may not be optimal for production:

- the database is in the same machine as the servers
- the storage uses the filesystem backend instead of S3

We strongly [recommend](/docs/guides/hosting/overview#managing-your-database) that you decouple your database
before deploying.
Each system can be [configured](/docs/guides/hosting/overview#configuration) to suit your particular use-case.

## Deploying

See the following guides to deploy Docker Compose setup using your preferred tool and platform:

- [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/stack-deploy/)
- [AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/deploy-applications-on-amazon-ecs-using-docker-compose/)
- [Using Kompose for Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/translate-compose-kubernetes/)
