description: Getting started with Supabase Platform Log Browser
---

The Supabase Platform provides a log browser that allows log tracing and debugging. Currently, PostgreSQL and Cloudflare edge logs are available.

The features discussed in this article are only available through the Supabase platform and are not available on self-hosted.

The log browser can be accessed through:

- `Project Overview > Settings > API`
- `Project Overview > Settings > Database`

## Basic Querying Features

- Simple regex-based search on the event message.
- Timestamp filtering to a point in time, through an ISO-8601 string in UTC timezone.

## Advanced Querying Features

To access advanced querying features, you will need to enable **custom queries**. Doing so will display an SQL editor that allows you to craft your queries.

`SELECT` queries allow complex and powerful aggregated result sets, letting you to perform in-depth analysis of your log data.

For example, you may enter the following into the API logs dashboard to query for each user's IP address:

```sql
SELECT timestamp, h.x_real_ip
FROM edge_logs
  LEFT JOIN UNNEST(metadata) as m ON TRUE
  LEFT JOIN UNNEST(m.request) AS r ON TRUE
  LEFT JOIN UNNEST(r.headers) AS h ON TRUE
WHERE h.x_real_ip IS NOT NULL
```

You may notice that the table name reference, `edge_logs`, is required in order to formulate the SELECT query. Likewise, when querying the database logs, you would need to provide a table name reference as well.

The table references are as follows:

- API Edge - `edge_logs`
- Database - `postgres_logs`

Note that cross-table joining is currently not supported.

#### Unnesting Arrays

In the above example, in order to query the metadata field, we need to unnest the field and add it as a join. Wehn we click on an individual log, we can see that log metadata is stored as an array of objects. 

In order to query any value that is an array, we would need to `UNNEST()` that field and add it to the query as a join, thereby allowing us to reference the nested fields within the array.


#### Functions

You may have also noticed from the above examples that we are able to use certain SQL functions within our queries. The querying engine currently supported is BigQuery, hence you may use [any valid BigQuery function](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/functions-and-operators) within your query. 


#### Timestamp Behavior

Each log timestamp is stored as a `TIMESTAMP` data type. In order to utilize the `timestamp` field in a query, you would need to use the appropriate [timestamp functions](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/timestamp_functions#timestamp).

### Template Queries

Templates are available to help shorten the time needed to craft these queries. There are examples for each complexity level, which can serve as a foundation for your custom queries.
