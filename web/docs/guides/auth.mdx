### User Management

Supabase makes it simple to manage your users.

</video>

When a user signs up, Supabase assigns them a unique ID. You can reference this ID anywhere in your database. For example, you might create a `profiles` table referencing the user using a `user_id` field.

Supabase provides the routes to [sign up](/docs/client/auth-signup), [login](/docs/client/auth-signin), [log out](/docs/client/auth-signout), and manage users in your apps and websites.


### Third Party Logins

We currently support the following OAuth providers:
- Google
- Github
- Gitlab
- Bitbucket

![OAuth Logins.](/img/supabase-oauth-logins.png)

You can enable providers by navigating to Authentication > Settings > External OAuth Providers and inputting your `Client ID` and `Secret` for each.

To fetch these you need to:

1. Generate `Client ID` and `Secret` ([google](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials), [github](https://github.com/settings/applications/new), [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/oauth/applications), [bitbucket](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/use-oauth-on-bitbucket-cloud/))
2. Enter Authorized Redirect URI: `https://<your-project>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback` on provider dashboard

### Row Level Security

Authentication only gets you so far. When you need granular authorization rules, nothing beats PostgreSQL's [Row Level Security](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-rowsecurity.html). Supabase makes it simple to turn RLS on and off.

### Policies

[Policies](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createpolicy.html) are PostgreSQL's rule engine. They are incredibly powerful and flexible, allowing you to write complex SQL rules which fit your unique business needs. 

<video width="99%"  muted playsInline controls="true">
<source src="/videos/policies-zoom2.mp4" type="video/mp4" muted playsInline />
</video>

With policies, your database becomes the rules engine. Instead of repetitively filtering your queries, like this ...

```js
const loggedInUserId = 'd0714948'
let { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('users')
    .select('user_id, name')
    .eq('user_id', loggedInUserId)

// console.log(data)
// => { id: 'd0714948', name: 'Jane' }
```

... you can simply define a rule on your database table, `auth.uid() = user_id`, and your request will return the rows which pass the rule, even when you remove the filter from your middleware:

```js
let user = await supabase
    .from('users')
    .select('user_id, name')

// console.log(data)
// Still => { id: 'd0714948', name: 'Jane' }
```

## How it works

1. A user signs up. Supabase creates a new user in the `auth.users` table.
2. Supabase returns a new JWT, which contains the user's `UUID`.
3. Every request to your database also sends the JWT.
4. Postgres inspects the JWT to determine the user making the request.
5. The user's UID can be used in Policies to restrict access to rows. 

Supabase provides a special function in Postgres, `auth.uid()`, which extracts the user's UID from the JWT. This is especially useful when creating Policies.
 
## Tips

### Never use a service key on the client.

Supabase provides special "Service" keys, which can be used to bypass all Row Level Security. 
These should never be used in the browser or exposed to customers, but they are useful for administrative tasks.

### Create a `public.users` table.

Even though Supabase provides an `auth.users` table, it is helpful to also create a users table in the `public` schema, which uses the same UUID Primary Key as the `auth.users`.
For security purposes, the `auth` schema is not exposed on the auto-generated API. Created a `public.users` table allows you to interact via the Supabase client - 
especially useful for cross-table queries.

Pro tip: if you want to add a row to your `public.users` table every time a user signs up, you can use triggers. For example:

```sql
-- inserts a row into public.users
create function public.handle_new_user() 
returns trigger as $$
begin
  insert into public.users (id)
  values (new.id);
  return new;
end;
$$ language plpgsql security definer;

-- trigger the function every time a user is created
create trigger on_auth_user_created
  after insert on auth.users
  for each row execute procedure public.handle_new_user();
```

### Policies are like where clauses.

Policies are easy to understand once you get the hang of them. You can just think of the as adding a `WHERE` clause to every query. For example if you had a policy like this:

```sql
create policy "Individuals can view their own todos." on todos for
    select using (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

It would translate to this whenever a user tries to select from the todos table:

```sql
select *
from todos
where auth.uid() = todos.user_id; -- Policy is implicitly added.
```
