Extensions are exactly as they sound - they "extend" the database with functionality which isn't part of the Postgres core.
Supabase has pre-installed some of the most useful open source extensions.


### Enable and disable extensions



<Tabs
defaultValue="UI"
values={[
  {label: 'UI', value: 'UI'},
  {label: 'SQL', value: 'SQL'},
]}>
<TabItem value="UI">

```sh
1. Go to the Database page
2. Click on "Extensions" in the sidebar 
3. Find the extension you would like to enable/disable 
4. Click the toggle.
```


<video width="99%" muted playsInline controls={true}>
<source src="/docs/videos/toggle-extensions.mp4" type="video/mp4" muted playsInline />
</video>



</TabItem>
<TabItem value="SQL">

```sql 

-- Example: enable the "pgtap" extension and ensure it is installed
create extension pgtap with schema extensions;

-- Example: disable the "pgtap" extension 
drop extension pgtap;

```

Even though the SQL code is `create extension`, this is the equivalent of "enabling the extension". 
To disable an extension you can call `drop extension`.

Enabling few extensions by the SQL code `create extension <extension-name> with schema extensions` may lead to permission issues (e.g. `dblink`, `http`, `pg_cron`).

</TabItem>

</Tabs>


### Full list of extensions

Supabase is pre-configured with over 50 extensions. You can also install your own SQL extensions directly into the database through our SQL editor.
