Supabase provides several options for programmatically connecting to your Postgres database:

## Types of Connection

- HTTP connections using the API.  
- Direct connections using Postgres' standard connection system.
- Connection pooling using PgBouncer.


### Direct vs Connection Pooling

A "direct connection" is when a connection is made to the database using Postgres' native connection implementation. 

A "connection pool" is a system (external to Postgres)
which manage connections, rather than Postgres' native system.

Why would you use a connection pool? Primarily because the way that Postgres handles connections isn't very scalable for a large number of _temporary_ connections. 
You can use these simple questions to determine which connection method to use:

- Are you connecting to a database and _maintaining_ a connection? If yes, use a direct connection.
- Are you connecting to your database and then _disconnecting_ immediately (e.g. a serverless environment)? If yes, use a connection pool.


## HTTP API

Supabase provides an auto-updating API. This is the easiest way to get started if you are managing data (fetching, inserting, updating). 


You cannot manage the database schema 
via the API (for security reasons). To do that you can use the dashboard or connect directly to your database.

### Finding your API URL

You can find the API URL and Keys inside the Dashboard.

<TabItem value="UI">

```sh
1. Go to the "Settings" section.
2. Click "API" in the sidebar.
3. Find your API URL and Keys in this page.

## Direct connections

Every Supabase project provides a full Postgres database. You can connect to the database using any tool which supports Postgres.

## Connection Pool

Connection pools are useful for managing a large number of _temporary_ connections. For example, if you are using [Prisma](/docs/guides/integrations/prisma) deployed to a Serverless environment.

### How connection pooling works

A "connection pool" is a system (external to Postgres) which manages connections, rather than PostgreSQL's native system. Supabase uses [PgBouncer](https://www.pgbouncer.org/) for connection pooling.

When a client makes a request, PgBouncer "allocates" an available connection to the client.
When the client transaction or session is completed the connection is returned to the pool and is free to be used by another client.

### Pool modes

Pool Mode determines how PgBouncer handles a connection.

#### Session

When a new client connects, a connection is assigned to the client until it disconnects. Afterward, the connection is returned back to the pool. 

All PostgreSQL features can be used with this option.

#### Transaction

This is the suggested option for serverless functions. A connection is only assigned to the client for the duration of a transaction. Two consecutive transactions from the same client 
could be executed over two different connections. 

Some session-based PostgreSQL features such as prepared statements are not available with this option. 
A comprehensive list of incompatible features can be found [here](https://www.pgbouncer.org/features.html).

#### Statement

This is the most granular option. Connections are returned to the pool after every statement. Transactions with multiple statements are not allowed. This is best used when `AUTOCOMMIT` is in use.
