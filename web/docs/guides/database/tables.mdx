Tables are where you store your data. 


Tables are similar to excel spreadsheets. They contain columns and rows. 
For example, this table has 3 "columns" (`id`, `name`, `description`) and 4 "rows" of data:

| `id`    | `name` | `description` |
| ----  | ---- | ----------- |
|    1 | The Phantom Menace | Two Jedi escape a hostile blockade to find allies and come across a young boy who may bring balance to the Force. |
|    2 | Attack of the Clones | Ten years after the invasion of Naboo, the Galactic Republic is facing a Separatist movement. |
|    3 | Revenge of the Sith | As Obi-Wan pursues a new threat, Anakin acts as a double agent between the Jedi Council and Palpatine and is lured into a sinister plan to rule the galaxy. |
|    4 | Star Wars | Luke Skywalker joins forces with a Jedi Knight, a cocky pilot, a Wookiee and two droids to save the galaxy from the Empire's world-destroying battle station. |

There are a few important differences from a spreadsheet, but it's a good starting point if you're new to Relational databases.

## Creating Tables


When creating a table, it's best practice to add columns at the same time. 

![Tables and columns](/img/guides/database/tables-columns.png)

You must define the "data type" of each column when it is created. You can add and remove columns at any time after creating a table. 

Supabase provides several options for creating tables. You can use the Dashboard or create them directly using SQL. 
We provide a SQL editor within the Dashboard, or you can [connect](/docs/guides/database/connecting/connecting-to-postgres) to your database 
and run the SQL queries yourself.


<Tabs
defaultValue="UI"
values={[
  {label: 'Dashboard', value: 'UI'},
  {label: 'SQL', value: 'SQL'},
]}>
<TabItem value="UI">


<video width="99%" muted playsInline controls="true">
<source src="/docs/videos/api/api-create-table-sm.mp4" type="video/mp4" muted playsInline />
</video>

```sh
1. Go to the "Table editor" section.
2. Click "New Table".
3. Enter the table name "todos".
4. Click "Save".
5. Click "New Column".
6. Enter the column name "task" and make the type "text".
7. Click "Save".
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="SQL">

```sql
create table movies (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  name text,
  description text
);
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

It is best practice to use lowercase and underscores when naming tables. For example: `table_name`, not `Table Name`.

## Columns 

You must define the "data type" when you create a column.


### Data types

Every column is a predefined type. PostgreSQL provides many [default types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype.html), and you can even design your own (or use extensions) 
if the default types don't fit your needs.

You can "cast" columns from one type to another, however there can be some incompatibilities between types. 
For example, if you cast a `timestamp` to a `date`, you will lose all the time information that was previously saved.

### Primary Keys 

A table can have a "primary key" - a unique identifier for every row of data. A few tips for Primary Keys:


- It's recommended to create a Primary Key for every table in your database.
- You can use any column as a primary key, as long as it is unique for every row.
- It's common to use a `uuid` type or a numbered `identity` column as your primary key. 

```sql
create table movies (
  id bigint generated always as identity primary key
);
```

In the example above, we have:

1. created a column called `id` 
1. assigned the data type `bigint`
1. instructed the database that this should be `generated always as identity`, which means that Postgres will automatically assign a unique number to this column. 
1. Becuase it's unique, we can also use it as our `primary key`.

We could also use `generated by default as identity`, which would allow us to insert our own unique values.

```sql
create table movies (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key
);
```

## Loading data 

There are several ways to load data in Supabase. You can load data directly into the database or using the [APIs](/docs/guides/api). 
Use the "Bulk Loading" instructions if you are loading large data sets.

### Basic data loading

<Tabs
defaultValue="SQL"
values={[
  {label: 'SQL', value: 'SQL'},
  {label: 'JavaScript', value: 'JS'},
  {label: 'Dart', value: 'DART'},
]}>
<TabItem value="SQL">

```sql
insert into movies 
  (name, description)
values
  ('The Empire Strikes Back', 'After the Rebels are brutally overpowered by the Empire on the ice planet Hoth, Luke Skywalker begins Jedi training with Yoda.'),
  ('Return of the Jedi', 'After a daring mission to rescue Han Solo from Jabba the Hutt, the Rebels dispatch to Endor to destroy the second Death Star.');
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="JS">

```sql
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('movies')
  .insert([{ 
    name: 'The Empire Strikes Back', 
    description: 'After the Rebels are brutally overpowered by the Empire on the ice planet Hoth, Luke Skywalker begins Jedi training with Yoda.' 
  }, { 
    name: 'Return of the Jedi', 
    description: 'After a daring mission to rescue Han Solo from Jabba the Hutt, the Rebels dispatch to Endor to destroy the second Death Star.' 
  }])
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="DART">

```sql
final res = await supabase
  .from('movies')
  .insert([{ 
    name: 'The Empire Strikes Back', 
    description: 'After the Rebels are brutally overpowered by the Empire on the ice planet Hoth, Luke Skywalker begins Jedi training with Yoda.' 
  }, { 
    name: 'Return of the Jedi', 
    description: 'After a daring mission to rescue Han Solo from Jabba the Hutt, the Rebels dispatch to Endor to destroy the second Death Star.' 
  }]).execute();
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Bulk data loading 

When inserting large data sets it's best to use PostgreSQL's [COPY](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-copy.html) command. 
This loads data directly from a file into a table. There are several file formats available for copying data: text, csv, binary, JSON, etc.

For example, if you wanted to load a CSV file into your movies table:

```csv title="./movies.csv"
"The Empire Strikes Back", "After the Rebels are brutally overpowered by the Empire on the ice planet Hoth, Luke Skywalker begins Jedi training with Yoda."
"Return of the Jedi", "After a daring mission to rescue Han Solo from Jabba the Hutt, the Rebels dispatch to Endor to destroy the second Death Star."
```

You would [connect](/docs/guides/database/connecting-to-postgres#direct-connections) to your database directly and load the file with the COPY command: 

```bash
psql -h DATABASE_URL -p 5432 postgres -U postgres \
  -c "COPY movies FROM './movies.csv';"
```


## Joining tables with Foreign Keys

Tables can be "joined" together using Foreign Keys.

![Foreign Keys](/img/guides/database/foreign-keys.png)

This is where the "Relational" naming comes from, as data typically forms some sort of relationship. 

In our "movies" example above, we might want to add a "category" for each movie (for example, "Action", or "Documentary"). 
Let's create a new table called `categories` and "link" our `movies` table.

```sql
create table categories (
  id bigint generated always as identity primary key,
  name text -- category name
);

alter table movies 
  add column category_id bigint references categories;
```

You can also create "many-to-many" relationships by creating a "join" table.
For example if you had the following situations:

- You have a list of `movies`.
- A movie can have several `actors`.
- An `actor` can perfom in several movies.

  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  name text,
  description text
);

create table actors (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  name text
);

create table performances (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  movie_id bigint not null references movies,
  actor_id bigint not null references actors
);
```

## Schemas 

Tables belong to `schemas`. Schemas are a way of organizing your tables, often for security reasons.

![Schemas and tables](/img/guides/database/schema-tables.png)

If you don't explicitly pass a schema when creating a table, Postgres will assume that you want to create the table in the `public` schema. 

We can create schemas for organizing tables. For example, we might want a private schema which is hidden from our API: 


```sql
create schema private;
```

Now we can create tables inside the `private` schema:

```sql
create table salaries (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  salary bigint not null,
  actor_id bigint not null references public.actors
);
```
