In PostgreSQL, data is stored in "tables".

Tables are made of "columns" and "rows", similar to a spreadsheet. For example:

| `id`    | `name` | `description` |
| ----  | ---- | ----------- |
|    1 | Toy Story | When a new toy called "Forky" joins Woody and the gang, a road trip alongside old and new friends reveals how big the world can be for a toy. |
|    2 | Monsters, Inc. | In order to power the city, monsters have to scare children so that they scream. However, the children are toxic to monsters. |
|    3 | Finding Nemo | After his son is captured in the Great Barrier Reef and taken to Sydney, a timid clownfish sets out on a journey to bring him home. |
|    4 | WALL-E | In the distant future, a small waste-collecting robot inadvertently embarks on a space journey that will ultimately decide the fate of mankind. |
|    5 | Up | 78-year-old Carl Fredricksen travels to Paradise Falls in his house equipped with balloons, inadvertently taking a young stowaway. |

This table has 3 "columns": `id`, `name`, and `description`, and 5 "rows" of data.

## Designing tables

Before you can store the data you need to "design" the table.
This is different from NoSQL databases where you can immediately put any data in your database. 

There is a big benefit however: data integrity. PostgreSQL will guarantee that each table fits the rules that you specify. 
As you scale, this will become incredibly important.

## Creating Tables

Supabase gives you several options for creating tables. You can use the Table Editor or create them directly using SQL.

<Tabs
defaultValue="UI"
values={[
  {label: 'UI', value: 'UI'},
  {label: 'SQL', value: 'SQL'},
]}>
<TabItem value="UI">

```sh
1. Go to the "Table editor" section.
2. Click "New Table".
3. Enter the table name "todos".
4. Click "Save".
5. Click "New Column".
6. Enter the column name "task" and make the type "text".
7. Click "Save".
```

<video width="99%" muted playsInline controls="true">
<source src="/videos/api/api-create-table-sm.mp4" type="video/mp4" muted playsInline />
</video>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="SQL">

```sql
-- Create a table called "todos" with a column to store tasks.

create table todos (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  task text check (char_length(task) > 3)
);
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Data types

Every column is a predefined type. PostgreSQL provides many [default types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype.html), and you can even design your own (or use extensions) 
if the default types don't fit your needs.

| `Name`                                        | `Aliases`              | `Description`                                                       |
