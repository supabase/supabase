description: How to change your PostgreSQL database password.

Your PostgreSQL database is the core of your Supabase project, so it's important that it has a strong, secure password at all times.
Your passwords should not contain of the following symbols: 

`: / ? # ] [ @ ! $ & ' ( ) * + , ; =`

Special symbols can conflict with connection string URLs, so it's best to avoid them. You can make a secure password using a longer string or a randomized set of upper and lowercase letters and digits.


### Changing your project password

When you created your project you were also asked to enter a password. This is actually the password for your database, specifically for the `postgres` user.
You can update this password from the Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.io):

> @TODO: clean this up. Also we should generate a random passowrd in the code snippet below otherwise everyone will copy/paste the same password.

- Home 
- Select a Project 
- SQL 
- New Query

<Tabs
defaultValue="SQL"
values={[
  {label: 'SQL', value: 'SQL'},
]}>

<TabItem value="SQL">

```sql
alter user postgres 
  with password 'new_password';
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Creating a secure password

- use a password manager to generate it
- make a long password (10 characters at least)
- don't use any common dictionary words
- use both upper and lower case characters, numbers, and any symbols not in the list above
