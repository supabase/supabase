Your PostgreSQL database is the core of your Supabase project, so it's important that it has a strong, secure password at all times.  

Changing the password is easy, just make sure you choose a password that:

* **is very secure**
* does not contain of the following symbols: `: / ? # ] [ @ ! $ & ' ( ) * + , ; =`

Special symbols can conflict with connection string URLs, so it's best to avoid them. You can make a secure password using a longer string or a randomized set of upper and lowercase letters and digits.

### How do I create a secure password?

- use a password manager to generate it
- make a long password (10 characters at least)
- don't use any common dictionary words
- use both upper and lower case characters, numbers, and any symbols not in the list above


## Steps

Issue the following statement in a SQL editor:

From the [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.io): 
- Home 
- Select a Project 
- SQL 
- New Query

<Tabs
defaultValue="SQL"
values={[
  {label: 'SQL', value: 'SQL'},
]}>

<TabItem value="SQL">

```sql
ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'new_password';
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


Be sure to remember your password or store it in a secure place.
