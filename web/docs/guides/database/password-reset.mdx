### How to change your PostgreSQL database password.

## Description

Your PostgreSQL database is the core of your Supabase project, so it's important to make sure it has a strong, secure password at all times.  Changing the password is easy -- just make sure you choose a password that:

* is very secure
* does not contain of the following symbols: **: / ? # ] [ @ ! $ & ' ( ) * + , ; =** 

These special symbols can conflict with connection string URLs or cause other problems, so it's best to avoid them.  You can still make a secure password using a longer string or a randomized set of upper and lowercase letters and digits.

## Environment
* Any PostgreSQL database
* Any Supabase project

## Steps

Issue the following statement in a SQL editor:

From the [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.io): 
- Home 
- Select a Project 
- SQL 
- New Query

<Tabs
defaultValue="SQL"
values={[
  {label: 'SQL', value: 'SQL'},
]}>

<TabItem value="SQL">

```sql
ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'new_password';
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


Be sure to remember your password or store it in a secure place.
