description: There are various ways to connect to your Postgres database.

Supabase provides two options for connection to your Postgres database:

- Direct connections.
- Connection pooling, using PgBouncer.

## Direct connection vs Connection Pooling

A "direct connection" is one where a connection is made to the database server using Postgres' native connection implementation. 
Supabase's connection pool [PgBouncer](https://www.pgbouncer.org/) to manage connections to the database server.

Why would you use a connection pool? Primarily because the way that Postgres handles connections isn't very scalable for a large number of _temporary_ connections. 
You can use these simple questions to determine which connection method to use:

- Are you connecting to a database an _maintaining_ a connection? If yes, use a direct connection.
- Are you connecting to your database and then _disconnecting_ immediately (like in a serverless environment)? If yes, use a connection pool.
