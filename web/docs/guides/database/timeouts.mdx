By default, Supabase limits the maximum statement execution time to _3 seconds_ for users accessing the API using the anon key, and _8 seconds_ for authenticated users. Additionally, all users are subject to a global limit of _2 minutes_. This serves as a backstop against resource exhaustion due to either poorly written queries, or abusive usage.

### Changing the default timeout

The timeout values were picked as a reasonable default for the majority of use-cases, but can be modified using the [`alter role`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/sql-alterrole.html) statement:

```sql
alter role authenticated set statement_timeout = '15s';
```

You can also update the statement timeout for a session:

```sql
set statement_timeout to 60000; -- 1 minute in milliseconds
```

### Statement Optimization

All Supabase projects come with the [`pg_stat_statements`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/pgstatstatements.html) extension installed, which tracks planning and execution statistics for all statements executed against it. These statistics can be used in order to diagnose the performance of your project.

This data can further be used in conjunction with the [`explain`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/using-explain.html) functionality of Postgres to optimize your usage.
