Supabase provides a CLI so that you can develop your application locally, rather than connecting to a live project.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

You will need to have these in your environment:

- Git
- Docker (make sure the daemon is up and running)
- Supabase CLI (instructions [here](https://github.com/supabase/cli))

### Initialize your project 

```bash
# create your project folder
mkdir your-project

# move into the new folder
cd your-project

# start a new git repository
git init
```

This command will create an empty folder for your project and start a new git repository.

### Initialize Supabase

```bash
supabase init
```

This command will create a `supabase` folder which holds all the configuration for developing your project locally.

### Start Supabase

```bash
supabase start
```

This command uses Docker to start all the open source [services](/docs/#how-it-works) of Supabase. This command will take a while to run, there are a lot of services to build.

Once this is running, you will see an output that contains your local Supabase credentials:

```txt
Started local development setup.

         API URL: http://localhost:54321
          DB URL: postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54322/postgres
      Studio URL: http://localhost:54323
        anon key: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJyb2xlIjoiYW5vbiJ9.ZopqoUt20nEV9cklpv9e3yw3PVyZLmKs5qLD6nGL1SI
service_role key: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJyb2xlIjoic2VydmljZV9yb2xlIn0.M2d2z4SFn5C7HlJlaSLfrzuYim9nbY_XI40uWFN3hEE
```

Now you can open a browser and visit the Studio at [http://localhost:54323](http://localhost:54323).

### Accessing Services Directly

<Tabs
defaultValue="Postgres"
values={[
  {label: 'Postgres', value: 'Postgres'},
  {label: 'API Gateway', value: 'Kong'},
]}>
<TabItem value="Postgres">

```sh
# Default URL:
postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54322/postgres
```

The local Postgres instance can be accessed through [`psql`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html)
or any other Postgres client, such as [pgadmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/).

For example:

```bash
psql 'postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54322/postgres'
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Kong">

```sh
# Default URL:
http://localhost:54321
```

All of the services are accessible through the API Gateway [Kong](https://github.com/Kong/kong)).
If you are accessing these services without the client libraries, you may need to pass the client keys as an `Authorization` header.
You can learn more about these JWT headers in our [Resources](/docs/learn/auth-deep-dive/auth-deep-dive-jwts).

```sh
curl 'http://localhost:54321/rest/v1/' \
    -H "apikey: <anon key>" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <anon key>"

http://localhost:54321/rest/v1/           # REST (PostgREST)
http://localhost:54321/realtime/v1/       # Realtime
http://localhost:54321/storage/v1/        # Storage
http://localhost:54321/auth/v1/           # Auth (GoTrue)
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Stop Supabase

```bash
supabase stop
```

Stop Supabase services and let's build a real application next.


## Example application

Now that we've learned how to install and start Supabase locally, let's see how you can use it with a frontend application.
This quick-start guide will show you, how you can configure a React app which uses the Supabase stack.

```bash
# create a fresh React app
npx create-react-app react-demo --use-npm

# move into the new folder
cd react-demo

# set up Supabase
supabase init

# Save the install supabase-js library
npm install --save @supabase/supabase-js
```

Now that your application is prepared, start the backend:

```bash
supabase start  # Start Supabase
```

You can use Supabase anywhere in your application. Copy this snippet into `src/App.js`:

```js
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

const SUPABASE_URL = '<your API URL>'
const SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = '<your anon key>'

const supabase = createClient(SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY)
```

Then start the frontend in a separate terminal:

```bash
npm start       # Start the React app
```

If everything is working, you should have a React app running on `http://localhost:3000` and Supabase services running on `http://localhost:54321`.

When you're finished with Supabase, send <kbd>Ctrl-C</kbd> to stop the application and run

```bash
supabase stop   # Stop Supabase
```

to stop Supabase services.

## Migrations

You can also use the CLI to manage your migrations. Follow the tour [here](https://github.com/supabase/cli/tree/main/examples/tour) to get started.
