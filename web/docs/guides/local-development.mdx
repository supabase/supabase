Supabase provides a CLI so that you can develop your application locally, rather than connecting to a live project.

:::note

Our CLI is still under heavy development, and is missing features which will deploy your local changes to your live project. 

:::


## Prerequisites

Our CLI makes heavy use of [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install), so make sure it is installed and configured on your machine before starting.

You will also need to install [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

## Install the CLI

```bash
npm install -g supabase
```


## Initialize your project

```bash
supabase init
```

You will be guided through a series of questions, and if everything went well, you will see an output similar to this:

```txt
✔ Port for Supabase URL: · 8000
✔ Port for PostgreSQL database: · 5432
✔ Project initialized.
Supabase URL: http://localhost:8000
Supabase Key: eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsImlhdCI6MTYwMzk2ODgzNCwiZXhwIjoyNTUwNjUzNjM0LCJhdWQiOiIiLCJzdWIiOiIiLCJSb2xlIjoicG9zdGdyZXMifQ.magCcozTMKNrl76Tj2dsM7XTl_YH0v0ilajzAvIlw3U
Database URL: postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres

Run supabase start to start local Supabase.
```

This command will create a `.supabase` folder which holds all the configuration for developing your project locally. You don't need to check this into version control. 


## Start


```bash
supabase start
```

This command uses Docker Compose to start all the open sources [services](/docs/#how-it-works) of Supabase. This command will take a while to run, there are a lot of services to build.

Once this is running, you will see the healthy services in Docker Dashboard:

#### Accessing Services Directly


<Tabs
defaultValue="Postgres"
values={[
  {label: 'Postgres', value: 'Postgres'},
  {label: 'API Gateway', value: 'Kong'},
]}>
<TabItem value="Postgres">

```sh
# Default URL:
postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres
```

The local Postgres instance can be accessed through [`psql`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html) 
or any other Postgres client, such as [pgadmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/).

For example:

```bash
psql -h localhost -d postgres -U postgres -W

# Enter your password (default is "postgres")
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Kong">

```sh
# Default URL:
http://localhost:8000/v1?apikey=SUPABASE_KEY
```

All of the services are accessible through the API Gateway [Kong](https://github.com/Kong/kong)). 
If you are accessing these services without the client libraries, you may need to pass the client keys as an `Authorization` header. 
You can learn more about these JWT headers in our [Resources](http://localhost:3005/docs/learn/auth-deep-dive/auth-deep-dive-jwts).


```sh
curl 'http://localhost:8000/v1' \
    -H "apikey: SUPABASE_KEY" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer SUPABASE_KEY"

http://localhost:8000/v1/rest/v1/           # REST (PostgREST)
http://localhost:8000/v1/realtime/v1/       # Realtime
http://localhost:8000/v1/storage/v1/        # Storage
http://localhost:8000/v1/auth/v1/           # Auth (GoTrue)
```


</TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Example application

Now that we've learned how to install and start Supabase locally, let's see how you can use it with a frontend application. 
This quick start will show you how you can configure a React app which uses Supabase stack.

```bash
# create a fresh React app
npx create-react-app react-demo --use-npm

# move into the new folder
cd react-demo

# set up Supabase 
supabase init 

# Save the install supabase-js library
npm install --save @supabase/supabase-js
```

Now that your application is now prepared, you can use Supabase anywhere in your application:

```js
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

const SUPABASE_URL = 'http://localhost:8000'
const SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = 'eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsImlhdCI6MTYwMzk2ODgzNCwiZXhwIjoyNTUwNjUzNjM0LCJhdWQiOiIiLCJzdWIiOiIiLCJSb2xlIjoicG9zdGdyZXMifQ.magCcozTMKNrl76Tj2dsM7XTl_YH0v0ilajzAvIlw3U'

const supabase = createClient(SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY)
```

Copy this snippet into `App.js`, and then start the backend and the frontend:

```bash
supabase start  # Start Supabase
npm start       # Start the React app
```

If everything is working you should have a React app running on `http://localhost:3000` and Supabase services running on `http://localhost:8000`

## Stop

```bash
supabase stop
```

When you are finished with Supabase, run `supabase stop` to stop the Docker services.

## Migrations

TBD
