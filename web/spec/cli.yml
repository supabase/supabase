    The Supabase CLI can be found in our [CLI](https://github.com/supabase/cli) repository.

    The CLI is still under heavy development, but it will contain all the functionality for working with Supabase projects and the Supabase platform.

    - [x] Running Supabase locally
    - [x] Self-hosting
    - [ ] Managing database migrations (in progress)
    - [ ] Pushing your local changes to production
    - [ ] Manage your Supabase Account
    - [ ] Manage your Supabase Projects
    - [ ] Generating types directly from your database schema
    - [ ] Generating API and validation schemas from your database

    ## Installing the CLI

    ```bash
    npm install supabase -g
    ```
    
    There may be additional steps that you need to follow to setup the CLI. Located [here](https://supabase.io/docs/guides/local-development).

      ```bash
      supabase init
      ```

      This command will create a .supabase folder which holds all the configuration for developing your project locally. You don't need to check this into version control.

      After you run `supabase init` you will be guided through a series of questions, and if everything goes well, you will see an output similar to this:

      ```txt
      ✔ Port for Supabase URL: · 8000
      ✔ Port for PostgreSQL database: · 5432
      ✔ Project initialized.
      Supabase URL: http://localhost:8000

      Database URL: postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres

      Run supabase start to start the local emulator.
      ```

  supabase start:

      ```bash
      supabase start
      ```

      This command uses Docker Compose to start all the open source [services](/docs/#how-it-works) of Supabase. This command will take a while to run, there are a lot of services to build.

      Once this is running, you will see the healthy services in Docker Dashboard:

      ![Docker Supabase](/img/docker-supabase.png)

  supabase stop:

      ```bash
      supabase stop
      ```

      When you are finished with Supabase, run `supabase stop` to stop the Docker services.

  supabase eject:

      ```bash
      supabase eject
      ```
      
      Run in any folder to create a `docker` folder with a `docker-compose.yml`. This is useful for self-hosting or adding custom configuration. 

      See our [Self Hosting](/docs/guides/hosting/overview) docs for more details.
