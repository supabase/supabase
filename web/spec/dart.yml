  Initializing:
    description: |
      You can initialize a new Supabase client using the `createClient()` method.

      The Supabase client is your entrypoint to the rest of the Supabase functionality
      and is the easiest way to interact with everything we offer within the Supabase ecosystem.

    examples:
      - name: example()
        dart: |
          ```dart
          TODO
          ```
      - name: example()
        dart: |
          ```dart
          TODO
          ```
