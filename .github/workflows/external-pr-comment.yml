            Thanks for contributing to Supabase! ❤️ Our team will review your PR.

            A few tips for a smoother review process:
            - If you have a local version of the repo, run \`pnpm run format\` to make sure formatting checks pass.
            - Once we've reviewed your PR, please don't trivially merge master (don't click \`Update branch\` if there are no merge conflicts to be fixed). This invalidates any pre-merge checks we've run.
