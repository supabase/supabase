# Supabase Edge Function Examples

## What are Supabase Edge Functions?

[Supabase Edge Functions](https://supabase.com/edge-functions) are written in TypeScript, run via Deno, and deployed with the Supabase CLI. Please [download](https://github.com/supabase/cli#install-the-cli) the latest version of the Supabase CLI, or [upgrade](https://github.com/supabase/cli#install-the-cli) it if you have it already installed.

## Example Functions

The function examples are located in [`./supabase/functions`](./supabase/functions):

- [`browser-with-cors`](./supabase/functions/browser-with-cors/index.ts): Handle CORS headers for function invocations from browser environments.
- [`select-from-table-with-auth-rls`](./supabase/functions/select-from-table-with-auth-rls/index.ts): Retrieve data from an authenticated user via RLS.
- [`send-email-smtp`](./supabase/functions/send-email-smtp/index.ts): Send an email using SMTP credentials.
- [`stripe-webhooks`](./supabase/functions/stripe-webhooks/index.ts): Handle Stripe Webhooks.
- [`telegram-bot`](./supabase/functions/telegram-bot/index.ts): Webhook handler for Telegram bots using [grammY](https://grammy.dev/).

## Develop locally

- Run `supabase start` (make sure your Docker daemon is running.)
- Run `mv ./supabase/.env.local.example ./supabase/.env.local` to rename the local `.env` file.
- Set the required variables to run the desired edge functions in the `.env.local` file.
- Run `supabase functions serve your-function-name --env-file ./supabase/.env.local`
- Run the CURL command in the example function, or use the [invoke method](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/invoke) on the Supabase client or use the test client [app](./app/).

## Test

This example includes a create-react-app in the [`./app/`](./app/) directory which you can use as a sort of postman to make test requests both locally and to your deployed functions.

### Test locally

- `cd app`
- `npm install`
- `npm start`

Note: when testing locally, the select dropdown doesn't have any effect, and invoke simply calls whatever function is currently served by the CLI.

## Deploy

- Generate access token and log in to CLI
  - Navigate to https://app.supabase.com/account/tokens
  - Click "Generate New Token"
  - Copy newly created token
  - Run `supabase login`
  - Input your token when prompted
- Link your project
  - Within your project root run `supabase link --project-ref your-project-ref`
- Set up your secrets
  - Run `supabase secrets set --env-file ./supabase/.env.local` to set the environment variables.
  
  (This is assuming your local and production secrets are the same. The recommended way is to create a separate `.env` file for storing production secrets, and then use it to set the environment variables while deploying.)
  - You can run `supabase secrets list` to check that it worked and also to see what other env vars are set by default.
- Deploy the function
  - Within your project root run `supabase functions deploy your-function-name`
- In your [`./app/.env`](./app/.env) file remove the `SUPA_FUNCTION_LOCALHOST` variable and restart your Expo app.

### Test deployed functions

This example includes a create-react-app in the [`./app/`](./app/) directory which you can use as a sort of postman to make test requests both locally and to your deployed functions.

- `cd app`
- `cp .env.example .env`
- Fill in your env vars from https://app.supabase.com/project/_/settings/api
- `npm install`
- `npm start`

### Deploy via GitHub Actions

This example includes a [deploy GitHub Action](./.github/workflows/deploy.yaml) that automatically deploys your Supabase Edge Functions when pushing to or merging into the main branch.

You can use the [`setup-cli` GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/supabase-cli-action) to run Supabase CLI commands in your GitHub Actions, for example to deploy a Supabase Edge Function:

```yaml
name: Deploy Function

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    env:
      SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
      PROJECT_ID: zdtdtxajzydjqzuktnqx

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - uses: supabase/setup-cli@v1
        with:
          version: 1.0.0

      - run: supabase functions deploy your-function-name --project-ref $PROJECT_ID
```

\o/ That's it, you can now invoke your Supabase Function via the [`supabase-js`](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/invoke) and [`supabase-dart`](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/dart/invoke) client libraries. (More client libraries coming soon. Check the [supabase-community](https://github.com/supabase-community#client-libraries) org for details).
