First of all, Figma clone is an over statement ðŸ˜‚ This app demonstrates the real-time communication capabilities of [Supabase](https://supabase.com) by creating an interactive design board where you can draw some shapes and move them around while seeing each other's cursors.

- Cursor position sharing in real-time
- Drawing shapes in real-time

## Run locally

- Run `supabase start` while docker running. If you don't have Supabase CLI yet, you can get it [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/getting-started).
- Run Flutter locally. The app should work on any platform, but is not optimized for mobile.
