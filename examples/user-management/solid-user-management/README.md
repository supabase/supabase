## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm dev` or `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles Solid in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Build from scratch

### 1. Create new project

Sign up to Supabase - [https://supabase.com/dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard) and create a new project. Wait for your database to start.

### 2. Run "User Management" Quickstart

Once your database has started, head over to your project's `SQL Editor` and run the "User Management Starter" quickstart. On the `SQL editor` page, scroll down until you see `User Management Starter: Sets up a public Profiles table which you can access with your API`. Click that, then click `RUN` to execute that query and create a new `profiles` table. When that's finished, head over to the `Table Editor` and see your new `profiles` table.

### 3. Get the URL and Key

Go to the Project Settings (the cog icon), open the API tab, and find your API URL and `anon` key, you'll need these in the next step.

The `anon` key is your client-side API key. It allows "anonymous access" to your database, until the user has logged in. Once they have logged in, the keys will switch to the user's own login token. This enables row level security for your data. Read more about this [below](#postgres-row-level-security).

**_NOTE_**: The `service_role` key has full access to your data, bypassing any security policies. These keys have to be kept secret and are meant to be used in server environments and never on a client or browser.

### 4. Env vars

Create `.env.local` from the `.env.example` file and populate this file with your URL and Key.

### 5. Run the application

Run the application: `npm run dev`. Open your browser to `https://localhost:3000/` and you are ready to go ðŸš€.

## Supabase details

### Postgres Row level security

This project uses very high-level Authorization using Postgres' Role Level Security.
When you start a Postgres database on Supabase, we populate it with an `auth` schema, and some helper functions.
When a user logs in, they are issued a JWT with the role `authenticated` and their UUID.
We can use these details to provide fine-grained control over what each user can and cannot do.

This is a trimmed-down schema, with the policies:

```sql
-- Create a table for Public Profiles
create table
	profiles (
		id uuid references auth.users not null,
		updated_at timestamp
		with
			time zone,
			username text unique,
			avatar_url text,
			website text,
			primary key (id),
			unique (username),
			constraint username_length check (char_length(username) >= 3)
	);

alter table
	profiles enable row level security;

create policy "Public profiles are viewable by everyone." on profiles for
select
	using (true);

create policy "Users can insert their own profile." on profiles for insert
with
	check (auth.uid () = id);

create policy "Users can update own profile." on profiles for
update
	using (auth.uid () = id);

-- Set up Realtime!
begin;

drop
	publication if exists supabase_realtime;

create publication supabase_realtime;

commit;

alter
	publication supabase_realtime add table profiles;

-- Set up Storage!
insert into
	storage.buckets (id, name)
values
	('avatars', 'avatars');

create policy "Avatar images are publicly accessible." on storage.objects for
select
	using (bucket_id = 'avatars');

create policy "Anyone can upload an avatar." on storage.objects for insert
with
	check (bucket_id = 'avatars');
```
