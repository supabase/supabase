# React Native User Management example with Expo

## Requirements

- Install the [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation/)

## Setup & run locally

### 1. Create new project

Sign up to Supabase - [https://app.supabase.io](https://app.supabase.io) and create a new project. Wait for your database to start.

### 2. Run "User Management Starter" Quickstart

Once your database has started, run the "User Management Starter" quickstart. Inside of your project, enter the `SQL editor` tab and scroll down until you see `User Management Starter`.

### 3. Get the URL and Key

Go to the Project Settings (the cog icon), open the API tab, and find your API URL and `anon` key, you'll need these in the next step.

The `anon` key is your client-side API key. It allows "anonymous access" to your database, until the user has logged in. Once they have logged in, the keys will switch to the user's own login token. This enables row level security for your data. Read more about this [below](#postgres-row-level-security).

**_NOTE_**: The `service_role` key has full access to your data, bypassing any security policies. These keys have to be kept secret and are meant to be used in server environments and never on a client or browser.

Set the details in the `/lib/supabase.js` file.

### 4. Install the dependencies & run the project:

Install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

Run the project:

```bash
yarn start
```
