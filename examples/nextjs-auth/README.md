# Example: Supabase authentication client- and server-side (API routes), and SSR with auth cookie.

This example shows how to use Supabase auth both on the client and server in both [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) and when using [server side rendering (SSR)](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#server-side-rendering).

This example is the same as [nextjs-with-supabase-auth](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/tree/master/examples/nextjs-with-supabase-auth) however it does not use the @supabase/ui Auth component.
