# Example: Supabase authentication client- and server-side (API routes), and SSR with auth cookie.

This example shows how to use Supabase auth both on the client and server in both [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) and when using [server side rendering (SSR)](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#server-side-rendering).

## Deploy with Vercel

The Vercel deployment will guide you through creating a Supabase account and project. After installation of the Supabase integration, all relevant environment variables will be set up so that the project is usable immediately after deployment ðŸš€
