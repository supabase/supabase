# Sveltejs todo with TailwindCSS - Snowpack, Backend Supabase

## Deploy your own

### 1. Create new project

Sign up to Supabase - [https://app.supabase.io](https://app.supabase.io) and create a new project. Wait for your database to start.

## configure .env

```
SUPABASE_URL=https://yoururl.supabase.io
SUPABASE_KEY=your-anon-key
```

## create db

run db/task_list_schema.sql

> ✨ Bootstrapped with Create Snowpack App (CSA).

## Available Scripts

### npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### npm test

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

### npm run build

Builds a static copy of your site to the `build/` folder.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

**For the best production performance:** Add a build bundler plugin like "@snowpack/plugin-webpack" or "@snowpack/plugin-parcel" to your `snowpack.config.json` config file.

### Q: What about Eject?

No eject needed! Snowpack guarantees zero lock-in, and CSA strives for the same.
