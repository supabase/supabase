# Flutter Supabase MFA Example

A simple app demonstrating how to implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) with Supabase and Flutter.

```sql
-- Dummy table that contains "secure" information
create table if not exists public.private_posts (
    id int generated by default as identity primary key,
    content text not null
);

-- Dmmy "secure" data
insert into public.private_posts
    (content)
values
    ('Flutter is awesome!'),
    ('Supabase is awesome!'),
    ('Postgres is awesome!');

-- Enable RLS for private_posts table
alter table public.private_posts enable row level security;

-- Create a policy that only allows read if they user has signed in via MFA
create policy "Users can view private_posts if they have signed in via MFA"
  on public.private_posts
  for select
  to authenticated
  using (auth.jwt()->>'aal' = 'aal2');
```
