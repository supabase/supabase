# Docs components

Supabase docs are written in MDX. The available custom components are
documented in @apps/docs/app/contributing/content.mdx.

# Linting

A prose linter is used to enforce the docs style and check for spelling.
Run the linter with `pnpm -F docs run lint:mdx -- --output rdf` to check for
lint issues and get suggested fixes.
