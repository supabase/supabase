      ## Dart

      Dart libraries are built and supported by the community.

      ```bash
      dart pub add supabase
      ```

      Find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-dart).

      ## Flutter

      For Flutter project, you can use [supabase_flutter](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-flutter).

      ```bash
      flutter pub add supabase_flutter
      ```

      `supabase_flutter` plugin uses `supabase` plugin internally, and it adds some Flutter specific functionality such as handling deeplinks coming back from magic link verifications.
      If you are creating a Flutter application, we recommend using `supabase_flutter` instead of `supabase`.

      For the most part `supabase_flutter` shares the same API as `supabase` with few exceptions such as initialization or OAuth sign in.

      ## Dart
      You can initialize a new Supabase client using the `SupabaseClient()` method.

      The Supabase client is your entrypoint to the rest of the Supabase functionality
      and is the easiest way to interact with everything we offer within the Supabase ecosystem.


      ## Flutter

      For `supabase_flutter`, you will be using the static `initialize()` method on `Supabase` class.

    examples:
      - id: dart-supabase-client
        name: Dart SupabaseClient()
        code: |
          ```dart
          final supabase = SupabaseClient('https://xyzcompany.supabase.co', 'public-anon-key');
          ```
      - id: flutter-initialize
        name: Flutter initialize()
        code: |
          ```dart title="main.dart"
          Future<void> main() async {
            await Supabase.initialize(url: 'https://xyzcompany.supabase.co', anonKey: 'public-anon-key');
            runApp(MyApp());
          }
          ```

  - id: sign-up
    title: 'signUp()'
    description: |
      Creates a new user.
    notes: |
      - By default, the user will need to verify their email address before logging in. If you would like to change this, you can disable "Email Confirmations" by going to Authentication -> Settings on [app.supabase.com](https://app.supabase.com)
      - If "Email Confirmations" is turned on, a user is returned but session will be null
      - If "Email Confirmations" is turned off, both a `user` and a `session` will be returned
      - When the user confirms their email address, they will be redirected to localhost:3000 by default. To change this, you can go to Authentication -> Settings on [app.supabase.com](https://app.supabase.com)
    examples:
      - id: sign-up
        name: Sign up.
        isSpotlight: true
        code: |
          ```dart
          final res = await supabase.auth.signUp('example@email.com',　'example-password');

          final user = res.data?.user;
          final error = res.error;
          ```

        name: Sign up with third-party providers.
        hideCodeBlock: true
        description: |
          If you are using Flutter, you can sign up with OAuth providers using the [`signInWithProvider()`](/docs/reference/dart/v0/auth-signinwithprovider) method available on `supabase_flutter`.

  - id: sign-in
    title: signIn()
    description: |
      Log in an existing user, or login via a third-party provider.
    notes: |
      - A user can sign up via email, phone number.
      - If you provide `email` without a `password`, the user will be sent a magic link.
      - The magic link's destination URL is determined by the SITE_URL config variable. To change this, you can go to Authentication -> Settings on [app.supabase.com](https://app.supabase.com)
      - Similarly, if you provide `phone` without a `password`, the user will be sent a one time password.
      - If you are looking to sign users in with OAuth in Flutter apps, go to [`signInWithProvider()`](/docs/reference/dart/v0/auth-signinwithprovider).
    examples:
      - id: sign-in-with-email-and-password
        name: Sign in with email.
        isSpotlight: true
        code: |
          ```dart

          final user = res.data?.user;
          final error = res.error;
          ```
      - id: sign-in-with-magic-link
        name: Sign in with magic link.
        description: If email is provided, but no password is provided, the user will be sent a "magic link" to their email address, which they can click to open your application with a valid session. By default, a given user can only request a Magic Link once every 60 seconds.
        code: |
          ```dart
          final res = await supabase.auth.signIn(email: 'example@email.com');

          final error = res.error;
          ```
      - title: get-oauth-sign-in-url
        name: Get OAuth sign in URL.
        description: |
          Passing provider parameter to `signIn()` will return a URL to sign your user in via OAuth.
          If you are looking to sign in a user via OAuth on Flutter app, go to [`signInWithProvider()`](/docs/reference/dart/v0/auth-signinwithprovider).
        code: |
          ```dart
          final res = await supabase.auth.signIn(provider: Provider.github);

          final url = res.data?.url;
          final error = res.error;

    title: signInWithProvider()
    description: |
      Signs the user in using third party OAuth providers.
    notes: |
      - `auth.signInWithProvider()` is only available on `supabase_flutter`
      - It will open the browser to the relevant login page.
    examples:
      - id: sign-in-with-provider

      - id: sign-in-with-scopes
        name: With scopes
        description: |
          If you need additional data from an OAuth provider, you can include a space-separated list of scopes in your request to get back an OAuth provider token.
          You may also need to specify the scopes in the provider's OAuth app settings, depending on the provider.
        code: |
          ```dart
          const { user, session, error } = await supabase.auth.signIn({
            provider: 'github'
          }, {
            scopes: 'repo gist notifications'
          })
          const oAuthToken = session.provider_token // use to access provider API
          ```

          ```dart
          final user = supabase.auth.user();
          ```

  - id: update-user
    title: updateUser()
    description: |
      Updates user data, if there is a logged in user.
    notes: |
      It's generally better to store user data in a table inside your public schema (i.e. `public.users`).
      Use the `update()` method if you have data which rarely changes or is specific only to the logged in user.
    examples:
      - id: update-the-users-metadata
        name: Update a user's metadata.
        isSpotlight: true
        code: |
          ```dart
          final res = await supabase.auth.update(
            UserAttributes(data: {'hello': 'world'})
          );

          final error = res.error;
          ```

  - id: on-auth-state-change

          final subscription = supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange((event, session) {
            print(session?.user?.id);
            // handle auth state change
          });
          ```

  - id: reset-password-for-email
    title: Reset Password (Email)
    description: |
      Sends a reset request to an email address.
    notes: |
      Sends a reset request to an email address.

      When the user clicks the reset link in the email they will be forwarded to:

      `<SITE_URL>#access_token=x&refresh_token=y&expires_in=z&token_type=bearer&type=recovery`

      Your app must detect `type=recovery` in the fragment and display a password reset form to the user.

      You should then use the access_token in the url and new password to update the user as follows:

      ```dart
      final res = await supabase.auth.api.updateUser(
        accessToken,
        UserAttributes(password: 'NEW_PASSWORD'),
      );
      ```
    examples:
      - id: reset-password
        name: Reset password
        isSpotlight: true
        code: |
          ```dart
          final res = await supabase.auth.api.resetPasswordForEmail('user@example.com');

          final error = res.error;
          ```
      - id: reset-password-for-flutter
        name: Reset password for Flutter
        isSpotlight: true
        code: |
          You can pass `redirectTo` to open the app via deeplink when user opens the password reset email.
          ```dart
          final res = await supabase.auth.api.resetPasswordForEmail(
            'user@example.com',
            options: AuthOptions(redirectTo: kIsWeb
                ? null
                : 'io.supabase.flutter://reset-callback/'),
          );

          final error = res.error;
          ```
  - id: invoke
    title: 'invoke()'
    description: |
      Invokes a Supabase Function. See the [guide](/docs/guides/functions) for details on writing Functions.
    notes: |
      - Requires an Authorization header.
      - Invoke params generally match the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) spec.
    examples:
      - id: basic-invocation
        name: Basic invocation.
        isSpotlight: true
        code: |
          ```dart

          final error = res.error;
          ```
      - id: specifying-response-type
        name: Specifying response type.
        description: |
          By default, `invoke()` will parse the response as JSON. You can parse the response in the following formats: `json`, `blob`, `text`, and `arrayBuffer`.
        isSpotlight: true
        code: |
          ```dart
          final res = await supabaseClient.functions.invoke(
            'hello',
            body: {'foo': 'baa'},
            responseType: ResponseType.text,
          );
          final data = res.data;
          final error = res.error;
          ```
      - id: parsing-custom-headers
        name: Parsing custom headers.
        description: |
          Any `headers` will be passed through to the function. A common pattern is to pass a logged-in user's JWT token as an Authorization header.
        isSpotlight: true
        code: |
          ```dart
          final res = await supabaseClient.functions.invoke(
            'hello',
            body: {'foo': 'baa'},
            headers: {
              'Authorization': 'Bearer ${supabase.auth.session()?.access_token}'
            },
          );
          ```
  - id: select
    description: |
      Performs vertical filtering with SELECT.
    title: 'Fetch data: select()'
    notes: |
      - By default, Supabase projects will return a maximum of 1,000 rows. This setting can be changed in Project API Settings. It's recommended that you keep it low to limit the payload size of accidental or malicious requests. You can use `range()` queries to paginate through your data.
      - `select()` can be combined with [Modifiers](/docs/reference/dart/using-modifiers)
      - `select()` can be combined with [Filters](/docs/reference/dart/using-filters)
      - If using the Supabase hosted platform `apikey` is technically a reserved keyword, since the API gateway will pluck it out for authentication. [It should be avoided as a column name](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/issues/5465).

        description: |
          Sometimes you will need to query the same foreign table twice.
          In this case, you can use the name of the joined column to identify
          which join you intend to use. For convenience, you can also give an
          alias for each column. For example, if we had a shop of products,
          and we wanted to get the supplier and the purchaser at the same time
          (both in the users) table:
        code: |

      - By default, every time you run `insert()`, the client library will make a `select` to return the full record.
      This is convenient, but it can also cause problems if your Policies are not configured to allow the `select` operation.
      If you are using Row Level Security and you are encountering problems, try setting the `returning` param to `minimal`.
    examples:
      - id: create-a-record
        name: Create a record
        isSpotlight: true
        code: |
          ```dart
          final res = await supabase
            .from('cities')
            .insert([
              {'name': 'The Shire', 'country_id': 554}
            ]).execute();
          ```
      - id: bulk-create
        name: Bulk create
        code: |
          ```dart
          final res = await supabase
            .from('cities')
            .insert([
              {'name': 'The Shire', 'country_id': 554},
              {'name': 'Rohan', 'country_id': 555},
            ]).execute();
          ```

  - id: update
    title: 'Modify data: update()'
    description: |
      Performs an UPDATE on the table.
    notes: |
      - `update()` should always be combined with [Filters](/docs/reference/dart/using-filters) to target the item(s) you wish to update.
    examples:
      - name: Updating your data
        isSpotlight: true
        dart: |
          ```dart
          final res = await supabase
            .from('cities')
            .update({ 'name': 'Middle Earth' })
            .match({ 'name': 'Auckland' })
            .execute();
          ```
      - name: Updating JSON data
        description: |
          Postgres offers a
          [number of operators](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html)
          for working with JSON data. Right now it is only possible to update an entire JSON document,
          but we are [working on ideas](https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/issues/465) for updating individual keys.
        dart: |
          ```dart
          final res = await supabase
            .from('users')
            .update({
              'address': {
                'street': 'Melrose Place',
                'postcode': 90210
              }
            })
            .eq('address->postcode', 90210)
            .execute();
          ```

  - id: upsert
    description: |
      Performs an UPSERT into the table.
    title: 'Upsert data: upsert()'
    notes: |
      - Primary keys should be included in the data payload in order for an update to work correctly.
      - Primary keys must be natural, not surrogate. There are however, [workarounds](https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/issues/1118) for surrogate primary keys.
    examples:
      - id: upsert-your-data
        name: Upsert your data
        isSpotlight: true
        code: |
          ```dart
          final res = await supabase
            .from('messages')
            .upsert({ 'id': 3, 'message': 'foo', 'username': 'supabot' })
            .execute();
          ```
      - id: upserting-into-tables-with-constraints
        name: Upserting into tables with constraints
        description: |
          Running the following will cause supabase to upsert data into the `users` table.
          If the username 'supabot' already exists, the `onConflict` argument tells supabase to overwrite that row
          based on the column passed into `onConflict`.
        isSpotlight: true
        code: |
          ```dart
          final res = await supabase
            .from('users')
            .upsert({ 'username': 'supabot' }, { 'onConflict': 'username' })
            .execute();
          ```
      - id: return-the-exact-number-of-rows
        name: Return the exact number of rows
        description: |
          Allowed values for count option are `exact`, `planned` and `estimated`.
        code: |
          ```dart
          final res = await supabase
            .from('users')
            .upsert({
                'id': 3,
                'message': 'foo',
                'username': 'supabot'
            })
            .execute(count: CountOption.exact);
          ```

  - id: delete
    title: 'Delete data: delete()'
    description: |
      Performs a DELETE on the table.
    notes: |
      - `delete()` should always be combined with [Filters](/docs/reference/dart/using-filters) to target the item(s) you wish to delete.
    examples:
      - id: delete-records
        name: Delete records
        isSpotlight: true
        code: |
          ```dart
          final res = await supabase
            .from('cities')
            .delete()
            .match({ 'id': 666 })
            .execute();
          ```

  - id: rpc
    title: 'Stored Procedures: rpc()'
    description: |
      You can call stored procedures as a "Remote Procedure Call".

      That's a fancy way of saying that you can put some logic into your database then call it from anywhere.
      It's especially useful when the logic rarely changes - like password resets and updates.
    examples:
      - id: call-a-stored-procedure
        name: Call a stored procedure
        isSpotlight: true
        description: This is an example invoking a stored procedure.
        code: |
          ```dart
          final res = await supabase
            .rpc('hello_world')
            .execute();
          ```
      - id: with-parameters
        name: With Parameters
        code: |
          ```dart
          final res = await supabase
            .rpc('echo_city', params: { 'name': 'The Shire' })
            .execute();
          ```
      - id: with-count-option
        name: With count option
        description: |
          You can specify a count option to get the row count along with your data.
          Allowed values for count option are `exact`, `planned` and `estimated`.
        code: |
          ```dart
          final res = await supabase
            .rpc('hello_world')
            .execute(count: CountOption.exact);
          ```

  - id: subscribe
    description: |
      Subscribe to realtime changes in your database.
    title: 'on().subscribe()'
    notes: |
      - Realtime is disabled by default for new Projects for better database performance and security. You can turn it on by [managing replication](/docs/guides/api#managing-realtime).
      - If you want to receive the "previous" data for updates and deletes, you will need to set `REPLICA IDENTITY` to `FULL`, like this: `ALTER TABLE your_table REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;`
    examples:
      - id: listen-to-all-database-changes
        name: Listen to all database changes
        isSpotlight: true
        code: |
          ```dart

          ```
      - id: listen-to-updates
        name: Listen to updates
        description: |
          By default, Supabase will send only the updated record. If you want to receive the previous values as well you can
          enable full replication for the table you are listening too:

          ```sql
          alter table "your_table" replica identity full;
          ```
        code: |
          ```dart
          final mySubscription = supabase
            .from('countries')
            .on(SupabaseEventTypes.update, (payload) {
              // Handle realtime payload
            })
            .subscribe();
          ```
      - id: listen-to-deletes
        name: Listen to deletes

  - id: remove-subscription
    description: |
      Removes an active subscription and returns the number of open connections.
    title: 'removeSubscription()'
    notes: |
      - Removing subscriptions is a great way to maintain the performance of your project's database. Supabase will automatically handle cleanup 30 seconds after a user is disconnected, but unused subscriptions may cause degradation as more users are simultaneously subscribed.
    examples:
      - id: remove-a-subscription
        name: Remove a subscription
        isSpotlight: true
        code: |
          ```dart

          final subscriptions = supabase.getSubscriptions();
          ```

  - id: stream
    description: |
      Notifies of data at the queried table.
    title: 'stream()'
    notes: |
      - `stream()` will emit the initial data as well as any further change on the database as `Stream` of `List<Map<String, dynamic>>` by combining Postgrest and Realtime.
      - Takes a list of primary key columns as its argument.
    examples:
      - id: listen-to-a-specific-table
        name: Listen to a specific table
        isSpotlight: true
        code: |
          ```dart
          supabase
            .from('countries')
            .stream(['id'])
            .execute();
          ```
      - id: listening-to-a-specific-rows-within-a-table
        name: Listening to a specific rows within a table
        description: |
          You can listen to individual rows using the format `{table}:{col}=eq.{val}` - where `{col}` is the column name, and `{val}` is the value which you want to match.
          This syntax is the as how you can filter data in Realtime
        code: |
          ```dart
          supabase
            .from('countries:id=eq.120')
            .stream(['id'])

    title: Using Filters
    description: |
      Filters can be used on `select()`, `update()`, and `delete()` queries.
      If a Stored Procedure returns a table response, you can also apply filters.
      Filters must be applied to the end of queries and can also be chained together to produce advanced queries.
    examples:
      - id: applying-filters

        code: |
          ```dart
          final res = await supabase

            .select('name, country_id')
            .eq('name', 'The Shire')    // Correct
            .execute();

          final res = await supabase
            .from('cities')
            .eq('name', 'The Shire')    // Incorrect

            .execute();
          ```

  - id: or
    title: or()
    description: |
      Finds all rows satisfying at least one of the filters.
    notes: |
      - `.or()` expects you to use the raw [PostgREST syntax](https://postgrest.org/en/stable/api.html#horizontal-filtering-rows) for the filter names and values.

        ```dart
        .or('id.in.(6,7),arraycol.cs.{"a","b"}')  // Use Postgres list () and 'in' for in_ filter. Array {} and 'cs' for contains.
        .or('id.in.(${mylist.join(',')}),arraycol.cs.{${mylistArray.join(',')}}')	// You can insert a Dart list for list or array column.
        .or('id.in.(${mylist.join(',')}),rangecol.cs.(${mylistRange.join(',')}]')	// You can insert a Dart list for list or range column.

        ```dart
        .not('name','eq','Paris')
        .not('arraycol','cs','{"a","b"}') // Use Postgres array {} for array column and 'cs' for contains.

          Uses PostgreSQL's `websearch_to_tsquery` function.
          This function will never raise syntax errors, which makes it possible to use raw user-supplied input for search, and can be used
          with advanced operators.

          - `unquoted text`: text not inside quote marks will be converted to terms separated by & operators, as if processed by plainto_tsquery.
          - `"quoted text"`: text inside quote marks will be converted to terms separated by `<->` operators, as if processed by phraseto_tsquery.
          - `OR`: the word “or” will be converted to the | operator.
          - `-`: a dash will be converted to the ! operator.

        code: |
          ```dart
          final res = await supabase
            .from('quotes')
            .select('catchphrase')

  - id: filter
    title: filter()
    description: |
      Finds all rows whose `column` satisfies the filter.
    notes: |
      - `.filter()` expects you to use the raw [PostgREST syntax](https://postgrest.org/en/stable/api.html#horizontal-filtering-rows) for the filter names and values, so it should only be used as an escape hatch in case other filters don't work.
        ```dart
          .filter('arraycol','cs','{"a","b"}') // Use Postgres array {} and 'cs' for contains.
          .filter('rangecol','cs','(1,2]') // Use Postgres range syntax for range column.
          .filter('id','in','(6,7)')  // Use Postgres list () and 'in' for in_ filter.
          .filter('id','cs','{${mylist.join(',')}}')  // You can insert a Dart array list.
