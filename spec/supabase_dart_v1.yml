  auth.signUp():
    description: |
      Creates a new user.
    notes: |
      - By default, the user will need to verify their email address before logging in. If you would like to change this, you can disable "Email Confirmations" by going to Authentication -> Settings on [app.supabase.com](https://app.supabase.com)
      - If "Email Confirmations" is turned on, a user is returned but session will be null
      - If "Email Confirmations" is turned off, both a `user` and a `session` will be returned
      - When the user confirms their email address, they will be redirected to localhost:3000 by default. To change this, you can go to Authentication -> Settings on [app.supabase.com](https://app.supabase.com)
    examples:
      - name: Sign up.
        isSpotlight: true
        dart: |
          ```dart
          final GotrueSessionResponse res = await supabase.auth.signUp('example@email.com', 'example-password');

          final User? user = res.user;
          ```
      - name: Sign up with third-party providers.
        hideCodeBlock: true
        description: |
          If you are using Flutter, you can sign up with OAuth providers using the [`signInWithProvider()`](/docs/reference/dart/auth-signinwithprovider) method available on `supabase_flutter`.

  auth.signIn():
    description: |
      Log in an existing user, or login via a third-party provider.
    notes: |
      - A user can sign up via email, phone number.
      - If you provide `email` without a `password`, the user will be sent a magic link.
      - The magic link's destination URL is determined by the SITE_URL config variable. To change this, you can go to Authentication -> Settings on [app.supabase.com](https://app.supabase.com)
      - Similarly, if you provide `phone` without a `password`, the user will be sent a one time password.
      - If you are looking to sign users in with OAuth in Flutter apps, go to [`signInWithProvider()`](/docs/reference/dart/auth-signinwithprovider).
    examples:
      - name: Sign in with email.
        isSpotlight: true
        dart: |
          ```dart
          final GotrueSessionResponse res = await supabase.auth.signIn(
            email: 'example@email.com',
            password: 'example-password',
          );

          final User? user = res.user;
          ```
      - name: Sign in with magic link.
        description: If email is provided, but no password is provided, the user will be sent a "magic link" to their email address, which they can click to open your application with a valid session. By default, a given user can only request a Magic Link once every 60 seconds.
        dart: |
          ```dart
          final GotrueSessionResponse res = await supabase.auth.signIn(
            email: 'example@email.com',
          );
          ```
      - name: Get OAuth sign in URL.
        description: |
          Passing provider parameter to `signIn()` will return a URL to sign your user in via OAuth. 
          If you are looking to sign in a user via OAuth on Flutter app, go to [`signInWithProvider()`](/docs/reference/dart/auth-signinwithprovider).
        dart: |
          ```dart
          final GotrueSessionResponse res = await supabase.auth.signIn(
            provider: Provider.github,
          );

          final User? user = res.user;
          ```
  auth.signInWithProvider():
    description: |
      Signs the user in using third party OAuth providers.
    notes: |
      - `auth.signInWithProvider()` is only available on `supabase_flutter`
      - It will open the browser to the relevant login page.
    examples:
      - name: Sign in with provider.
        isSpotlight: true
        dart: |
          ```dart
          await supabase.auth.signInWithProvider(Provider.github);
          ```
      - name: With `redirectTo`
        description: |
          Specify the redirect link to bring back the user via deeplink.
          Note that `redirectTo` should be null for Flutter Web.
        dart: |
          ```dart
          await supabase.auth.signInWithProvider(
            Provider.github,
            options: const AuthOptions(
              redirectTo: kIsWeb ? null : 'io.supabase.flutter://reset-callback/',
            ),
          );
          ```
      - name: With scopes
        description: |
          If you need additional data from an OAuth provider, you can include a space-separated list of scopes in your request to get back an OAuth provider token.
          You may also need to specify the scopes in the provider's OAuth app settings, depending on the provider.
        dart: |
          ```dart
          await supabase.auth.signInWithProvider(Provider.github,
              options: const AuthOptions(scopes: 'repo gist notifications'));
          ...
          // after user comes back from signin flow

          final Session? session = supabase.auth.currentSession;
          final String? oAuthToken = session?.providerToken;
          ```
  auth.signOut():
    description: |
      Signs out the current user, if there is a logged in user.
    examples:
      - name: Sign out
        isSpotlight: true
        dart: |
          ```dart
          await supabase.auth.signOut();
          ```

  auth.currentSession:
    description: |
      Returns the session data, if there is an active session.
    examples:
      - name: Get the session data
        isSpotlight: true
        dart: |
          ```dart
          final Session? session = supabase.auth.currentSession;
          ```

  auth.currentUser:
    description: |
      Returns the user data, if there is a logged in user.
    examples:
      - name: Get the logged in user
        isSpotlight: true
        dart: |
          ```dart
          final User? user = supabase.auth.currentUser;
          ```

  auth.update():
    description: |
      Updates user data, if there is a logged in user.
    notes: |
      It's generally better to store user data in a table inside your public schema (i.e. `public.users`). 
      Use the `update()` method if you have data which rarely changes or is specific only to the logged in user.
    examples:
      - name: Update a user's metadata.
        isSpotlight: true
        dart: |
          ```dart
          final GotrueUserResponse res = await supabase.auth.update(
            UserAttributes(data: {'hello': 'world'}),
          );
          ```

  auth.onAuthStateChange():
    description: |
      Receive a notification every time an auth event happens.
    examples:
      - name: Listen to auth changes
        isSpotlight: true
        dart: |
          ```dart
          final subscription = supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange(
            (event, session) {
              print(session?.user?.id);
              // handle auth state change
            },
          );
          ```

  Reset Password (Email):
    description: |
      Sends a reset request to an email address.
    notes: |
      Sends a reset request to an email address.

      When the user clicks the reset link in the email they will be forwarded to:

      `<SITE_URL>#access_token=x&refresh_token=y&expires_in=z&token_type=bearer&type=recovery`

      Your app must detect `type=recovery` in the fragment and display a password reset form to the user.

      You should then use the access_token in the url and new password to update the user as follows:

      ```dart
      final res = await supabase.auth.api.updateUser(
        accessToken,
        UserAttributes(password: 'NEW_PASSWORD'),
      );
      ```
    examples:
      - name: Reset password for Flutter
        isSpotlight: true
        dart: |
          You can pass `redirectTo` to open the app via deeplink when user opens the password reset email. 
          ```dart
          final res = await supabase.auth.api.resetPasswordForEmail(
            'user@example.com',
            options: AuthOptions(redirectTo: kIsWeb
                ? null
                : 'io.supabase.flutter://reset-callback/'),
          );
          ```
      - name: Reset password
        isSpotlight: true
        dart: |
          ```dart
          final res = await supabase.auth.api.resetPasswordForEmail('user@example.com');
          ```
  invoke():
    title: 'invoke()'
    description: |
      Invokes a Supabase Function. See the [guide](/docs/guides/functions) for details on writing Functions.
    notes: |
      - Requires an Authorization header.
      - Invoke params generally match the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) spec.
    examples:
      - name: Basic invocation.
        isSpotlight: true
        dart: |
          ```dart
          final res = await supabase.functions.invoke('hello', body: {'foo': 'baa'});
          final data = res.data;
          ```
      - name: Specifying response type.
        description: |
          By default, `invoke()` will parse the response as JSON. You can parse the response in the following formats: `json`, `blob`, `text`, and `arrayBuffer`.
        isSpotlight: true
        dart: |
          ```dart
          final res = await supabase.functions.invoke(
            'hello',
            body: {'foo': 'baa'},
            responseType: ResponseType.text,
          );
          final data = res.data;
          ```
      - name: Parsing custom headers.
        description: |
          Any `headers` will be passed through to the function. A common pattern is to pass a logged-in user's JWT token as an Authorization header.
        isSpotlight: true
        dart: |
          ```dart
          final res = await supabase.functions.invoke(
            'hello',
            body: {'foo': 'baa'},
            headers: {
              'Authorization': 'Bearer ${supabase.auth.currentSession?.accessToken}'
            },
          );
          ```
  select():
    description: |
      Performs vertical filtering with SELECT.
    title: 'Fetch data: select()'
    notes: |
      - By default, Supabase projects will return a maximum of 1,000 rows. This setting can be changed in Project API Settings. It's recommended that you keep it low to limit the payload size of accidental or malicious requests. You can use `range()` queries to paginate through your data.
      - `select()` can be combined with [Modifiers](/docs/reference/dart/using-modifiers)
      - `select()` can be combined with [Filters](/docs/reference/dart/using-filters)
      - If using the Supabase hosted platform `apikey` is technically a reserved keyword, since the API gateway will pluck it out for authentication. [It should be avoided as a column name](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/issues/5465).
    examples:
      - name: Getting your data
        isSpotlight: true
        dart: |
          ```dart
          final data = await supabase
            .from('cities')
            .select('name');
          ```
      - name: Selecting specific columns
        description: You can select specific fields from your tables.
        dart: |
          ```dart
          final data = await supabase
            .from('countries')
            .select('''
              name,
              cities (
                name
              )
            ''');
          ```
      - name: Query foreign tables
        description: If your database has relationships, you can query related tables too.
        dart: |
          ```dart
          final data = await supabase
            .from('products')
            .select('''
              id,
              supplier:supplier_id ( name ),
              purchaser:purchaser_id ( name )
            ''');
          ```
      - name: Query the same foreign table multiple times
        description: |
          Sometimes you will need to query the same foreign table twice. 
          In this case, you can use the name of the joined column to identify 
          which join you intend to use. For convenience, you can also give an 
          alias for each column. For example, if we had a shop of products, 
          and we wanted to get the supplier and the purchaser at the same time 
          (both in the users) table:
        dart: |
          ```dart
          final data = await supabase
            .from('messages')
            .select('*, users!inner(*)')
            .eq('users.username', 'Jane');
          ```
      - name: Filtering with inner joins
        description: |
          If you want to filter a table based on a child table's values you can use the `!inner()` function. For example, if you wanted 
          to select all rows in a `message` table which belong to a user with the `username` "Jane":
        dart: |
          ```dart
          final data = await supabase
            .from('messages')
            .select('*, users!inner(*)')
            .eq('users.username', 'Jane');
          ```
      - name: Querying with count option
        description: |
          You can get the number of rows by using the count option.
          Allowed values for count option are [exact](https://postgrest.org/en/stable/api.html#exact-count), [planned](https://postgrest.org/en/stable/api.html#planned-count) and [estimated](https://postgrest.org/en/stable/api.html#estimated-count).
        dart: |
          ```dart
          final res = await supabase.from('cities').select(
                'name',
                const FetchOptions(
                  count: CountOption.exact,
                ),
              );

          final count = res.count;
          ```
      - name: Querying JSON data
        description: |
          If you have data inside of a JSONB column, you can apply select 
          and query filters to the data values. Postgres offers a 
          [number of operators](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html) 
          for querying JSON data. Also see 
          [PostgREST docs](http://postgrest.org/en/v7.0.0/api.html#json-columns) for more details.
        dart: |
          ```dart
          final data = await supabase
            .from('users')
            .select('''
              id, name,
              address->street
            ''')
            .eq('address->postcode', 90210);
          ```
      - name: Return data as CSV
        description: |
          By default the data is returned in JSON format, however you can also request for it to be returned as Comma Separated Values.
        dart: |
          ```dart
          final data = await supabase
            .from('users')
            .select()
            .csv();
          ```

  insert():
    description: |
      Performs an INSERT into the table.
    title: 'Create data: insert()'
    examples:
      - name: Create a record
        isSpotlight: true
        dart: |
          ```dart
          final data = await supabase
              .from('cities')
              .insert({'name': 'The Shire', 'country_id': 554});
          ```
      - name: Bulk create
        dart: |
          ```dart
          final res = await supabase.from('cities').insert([
            {'name': 'The Shire', 'country_id': 554},
            {'name': 'Rohan', 'country_id': 555},
          ]);
          ```

  update():
    description: |
      Performs an UPDATE on the table.
    title: 'Modify data: update()'
    notes: |
      - `update()` should always be combined with [Filters](/docs/reference/dart/using-filters) to target the item(s) you wish to update.
    examples:
      - name: Updating your data
        isSpotlight: true
        dart: |
          ```dart
          final data = await supabase
            .from('cities')
            .update({ 'name': 'Middle Earth' })
            .match({ 'name': 'Auckland' });
          ```
      - name: Updating JSON data
        description: |
          Postgres offers a 
          [number of operators](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html) 
          for working with JSON data. Right now it is only possible to update an entire JSON document, 
          but we are [working on ideas](https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/issues/465) for updating individual keys.
        dart: |
          ```dart
          final data = await supabase
            .from('users')
            .update({
              'address': {
                'street': 'Melrose Place',
                'postcode': 90210
              }
            })
            .eq('address->postcode', 90210);
          ```

  upsert():
    description: |
      Performs an UPSERT into the table.
    title: 'Upsert data: upsert()'
    notes: |
      - Primary keys should be included in the data payload in order for an update to work correctly. 
      - Primary keys must be natural, not surrogate. There are however, [workarounds](https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/issues/1118) for surrogate primary keys.
    examples:
      - name: Upsert your data
        isSpotlight: true
        dart: |
          ```dart
          final data = await supabase

            .upsert({ 'id': 3, 'message': 'foo', 'username': 'supabot' });
          ```
      - name: Upserting into tables with constraints
        description: |
          Running the following will cause supabase to upsert data into the `users` table. 
          If the username 'supabot' already exists, the `onConflict` argument tells supabase to overwrite that row 
          based on the column passed into `onConflict`.
        isSpotlight: true
        dart: |
          ```dart

            .upsert({ 'username': 'supabot' }, { 'onConflict': 'username' });
          ```
      - name: Return the exact number of rows
        description: |
          Allowed values for count option are `exact`, `planned` and `estimated`.
        dart: |
          ```dart
          final res = await supabase.from('users').upsert(
            {'id': 3, 'message': 'foo', 'username': 'supabot'},
            options: const FetchOptions(count: CountOption.exact),
          );

          final data = res.data;
          final count = res.count;
          ```

  delete():
    description: |
      Performs a DELETE on the table.
    title: 'Delete data: delete()'
    notes: |
      - `delete()` should always be combined with [Filters](/docs/reference/dart/using-filters) to target the item(s) you wish to delete.

  rpc():
    title: 'Stored Procedures: rpc()'
    description: |
      You can call stored procedures as a "Remote Procedure Call".

      That's a fancy way of saying that you can put some logic into your database then call it from anywhere.
      It's especially useful when the logic rarely changes - like password resets and updates.
    examples:
      - name: Call a stored procedure
        isSpotlight: true
        description: This is an example invoking a stored procedure.
        dart: |

  subscribe():
    description: |
      Subscribe to realtime changes in your database.
    title: 'on().subscribe()'
    notes: |
      - Realtime is disabled by default for new Projects for better database performance and security. You can turn it on by [managing replication](/docs/guides/api#managing-realtime).
      - If you want to receive the "previous" data for updates and deletes, you will need to set `REPLICA IDENTITY` to `FULL`, like this: `ALTER TABLE your_table REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;`

  removeChannel():
    description: |
      Unsubscribes and removes Realtime channel from Realtime client.
    title: 'removeChannel()'
    notes: |
      - Removing a channel is a great way to maintain the performance of your project's Realtime service as well as your database if you're listening to Postgres changes. Supabase will automatically handle cleanup 30 seconds after a client is disconnected, but unused channels may cause degradation as more clients are simultaneously subscribed.
    examples:
      - name: Remove a channel
        isSpotlight: true
        dart: |
          ```dart
          final status = await supabase.removeChannel(channel);

  stream():
    description: |
      Notifies of data at the queried table.
    title: 'stream()'
    notes: |
      - `stream()` will emit the initial data as well as any further change on the database as `Stream` of `List<Map<String, dynamic>>` by combining Postgrest and Realtime.
      - Takes a list of primary key columns as its argument.
    examples:
      - name: Listening to a specific table
        isSpotlight: true
        dart: |
          ```dart

      - name: Listening to a specific rows within a table
        description: |
          You can listen to individual rows using the format `{table}:{col}=eq.{val}` - where `{col}` is the column name, and `{val}` is the value which you want to match.
          This syntax is the as how you can filter data in Realtime
        dart: |
          ```dart
          supabase.from('countries')
            .stream(['id'])
            .eq('id', '120')

        description: |
          When using `stream()` with a `StreamBuilder` within your Flutter application, make sure to store your stream in a variable to prevent refetching upon rebuilding.

          final supabase = Supabase.instance.client;

          class MyWidget extends StatefulWidget {

          }

          class _MyWidgetState extends State<MyWidget> {
            // Persist the stream in a local variable to prevent refetching upon rebuilds
            final _stream = supabase.from('countries').stream(['id']);

            @override

      If a Stored Procedure returns a table response, you can also apply modifiers to the `rpc()` function.

  limit():
    description: |
      Limits the result with the specified count.
    examples:
      - name: With `select()`
        isSpotlight: true
        dart: |
          ```dart
          final data = await supabase
            .from('cities')
            .select('name, country_id')
            .limit(1);
          ```
      - name: With embedded resources
        dart: |
          ```dart
          final data = await supabase
            .from('countries')
            .select('name, cities(name)')
            .eq('name', 'United States')
            .limit(1,  foreignTable: 'cities' );
          ```

  order():
    description: |
      Orders the result with the specified column.
    examples:
      - name: With `select()`
        isSpotlight: true
        dart: |
          ```dart
          final data = await supabase
            .from('cities')
            .select('name, country_id')
            .order('id',  ascending: false );
          ```
      - name: With embedded resources
        dart: |
          ```dart
          final data = await supabase
            .from('countries')
            .select('name, cities(name)')
            .eq('name', 'United States')
            .order('name', foreignTable: 'cities');
          ```

  range():
    description: |
      Limits the result to rows within the specified range, inclusive.
    examples:
      - name: With `select()`
        isSpotlight: true
        dart: |
          ```dart
          final data = await supabase
            .from('cities')
            .select('name, country_id')
            .range(0,3);
          ```

  single():
    description: |
      Retrieves only one row from the result. Result must be one row (e.g. using limit), otherwise this will result in an error.
    examples:
      - name: With `select()`
        isSpotlight: true
        dart: |
          ```dart
          final data = await supabase
            .from('cities')
            .select('name, country_id')
            .single();
          ```

  Using Filters:
    description: |
      Filters can be used on `select()`, `update()`, and `delete()` queries. 

      If a Stored Procedure returns a table response, you can also apply filters.

      ### Applying Filters

      You must apply your filters to the end of your query. For example:

      ```dart
      final data = await supabase
        .from('cities')
        .select('name, country_id')
        .eq('name', 'The Shire');    // Correct

      final data = await supabase
        .from('cities')
        .eq('name', 'The Shire')    // Incorrect
        .select('name, country_id');
      ```

      ### Chaining

      Filters can be chained together to produce advanced queries. For example:

      ```dart
      final data = await supabase
        .from('cities')
        .select('name, country_id')
        .gte('population', 1000)
        .lt('population', 10000);
      ```

  .or():
    description: |
      Finds all rows satisfying at least one of the filters.
    notes: |
      - `.or()` expects you to use the raw [PostgREST syntax](https://postgrest.org/en/stable/api.html#horizontal-filtering-rows) for the filter names and values.

        ```dart
        .or('id.in.(6,7),arraycol.cs.{"a","b"}')  // Use Postgres list () and 'in' for in_ filter. Array {} and 'cs' for contains.
        .or('id.in.(${mylist.join(',')}),arraycol.cs.{${mylistArray.join(',')}}')	// You can insert a Dart list for list or array column.
        .or('id.in.(${mylist.join(',')}),rangecol.cs.(${mylistRange.join(',')}]')	// You can insert a Dart list for list or range column.
        ```
    examples:
      - name: With `select()`
        isSpotlight: true
        dart: |
          ```dart
          final data = await supabase
            .from('cities')
            .select('name, country_id')
            .or('id.eq.20,id.eq.30');
          ```
      - name: Use `or` with `and`
        dart: |
          ```dart
          final data = await supabase
            .from('cities')
            .select('name, country_id')
            .or('id.gt.20,and(name.eq.New Zealand,name.eq.France)');
          ```

  .not():
    description: |
      Finds all rows which doesn't satisfy the filter.
    notes: |
      - `.not()` expects you to use the raw [PostgREST syntax](https://postgrest.org/en/stable/api.html#horizontal-filtering-rows) for the filter names and values.

        ```dart
        .not('name','eq','Paris')
        .not('arraycol','cs','{"a","b"}') // Use Postgres array {} for array column and 'cs' for contains.
        .not('rangecol','cs','(1,2]') // Use Postgres range syntax for range column.
        .not('id','in','(6,7)')  // Use Postgres list () and 'in' for in_ filter.
        .not('id','in','(${mylist.join(',')})')  // You can insert a Dart list array.
        ```

          This function will never raise syntax errors, which makes it possible to use raw user-supplied input for search, and can be used 
          with advanced operators.

          - `unquoted text`: text not inside quote marks will be converted to terms separated by & operators, as if processed by plainto_tsquery.
          - `"quoted text"`: text inside quote marks will be converted to terms separated by <-> operators, as if processed by phraseto_tsquery.
          - `OR`: the word “or” will be converted to the | operator.
          - `-`: a dash will be converted to the ! operator.

  .filter():
    description: |

    notes: |
      - `.filter()` expects you to use the raw [PostgREST syntax](https://postgrest.org/en/stable/api.html#horizontal-filtering-rows) for the filter names and values, so it should only be used as an escape hatch in case other filters don't work.
        ```dart
          .filter('arraycol','cs','{"a","b"}') // Use Postgres array {} and 'cs' for contains.
          .filter('rangecol','cs','(1,2]') // Use Postgres range syntax for range column.
          .filter('id','in','(6,7)')  // Use Postgres list () and 'in' for in_ filter.
          .filter('id','cs','{${mylist.join(',')}}')  // You can insert a Dart array list.
