    description: |
      You can initialize Supabase with the `SupabaseClient` by passing your `Project URL` and `Project Key`. You can find these under your `Project Settings` → `API Settings`
      The Supabase client is your entrypoint to the rest of the Supabase functionality and is the easiest way to interact with everything we offer within the Supabase ecosystem.

    examples:
      - id: initialize-client
        name: Initialize Client
        code: |
          ```js
          let client = SupabaseClient(supabaseURL: "https://xyzcompany.supabase.co'", supabaseKey: "public-anon-key")
          ```

    title: 'Fetch data: select()'
    $ref: '@supabase/postgrest-js."lib/PostgrestQueryBuilder".PostgrestQueryBuilder.select'
    notes: |
      - By default, Supabase projects will return a maximum of 1,000 rows. This setting can be changed in Project API Settings. It's recommended that you keep it low to limit the payload size of accidental or malicious requests. You can use `range()` queries to paginate through your data.
      - `select()` can be combined with [Modifiers](/docs/reference/javascript/using-modifiers)
      - `select()` can be combined with [Filters](/docs/reference/javascript/using-filters)
      - If using the Supabase hosted platform `apikey` is technically a reserved keyword, since the API gateway will pluck it out for authentication. [It should be avoided as a column name](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/issues/5465).
      - The recommended solution for getting data is to use the value property which will return a decoded model. Create a struct codable model of the of your database to get this easily decoded.
    examples:
      - id: getting-your-data
        name: Getting your data

          ```
        note: |
          What about join tables
          If you're in a situation where your tables are **NOT** directly related, but instead are joined by a _join table_,
          you can still use the `select()` method to query the related data. The PostgREST engine detects the relationship automatically.
          For more details, [follow the link](https://postgrest.org/en/latest/api.html#embedding-through-join-tables).

        name: Query the same foreign table multiple times
        description: |
          Sometimes you will need to query the same foreign table twice.
          In this case, you can use the name of the joined column to identify
          which join you intend to use. For convenience, you can also give an
          alias for each column. For example, if we had a shop of products,
          and we wanted to get the supplier and the purchaser at the same time
          (both in the users) table
        code: |
          ```js
          let messages: [MessageModel] = try await client.database

        description: |
          If you have data inside of a JSONB column, you can apply select
          and query filters to the data values. Postgres offers a
          [number of operators](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html)
          for querying JSON data. Also see
          [PostgREST docs](http://postgrest.org/en/v7.0.0/api.html#json-columns) for more details.
        code: |
          ```js
          let users: [UserModel] = try await client.database

  - id: insert
    title: 'Create data: insert()'
    $ref: '@supabase/postgrest-js."lib/PostgrestQueryBuilder".PostgrestQueryBuilder.insert'
    notes: |
      - By default, every time you run `insert()`, the client library will make a `select` to return the full record.
      This is convenient, but it can also cause problems if your policies are not configured to allow the `select` operation.
      If you are using Row Level Security and you are encountering problems, try setting the `returning` param to `minimal`.
    examples:
      - id: create-a-record
        name: Create a record
        isSpotlight: true
        code: |
          ```js

        description: |
          When running a bulk create, the operation is handled in a single transaction. If any of the inserts fail, all other operations are
          rolled back.
        code: |
          ```js
          let theShire = CityModel(name:"The Shire", country_id: 554)

          Postgres offers a
          [number of operators](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html)
          for working with JSON data. Right now it is only possible to update an entire JSON document,

    notes: |
      - Primary keys should be included in the data payload in order for an update to work correctly.
      - Primary keys  must be natural, not surrogate. There are however, [workarounds](https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/issues/1118) for surrogate primary keys.
      - If you need to insert new data and update existing data at the same time, use [Postgres triggers](https://github.com/supabase/postgrest-js/issues/173#issuecomment-825124550).

    notes: |
      - `delete()` should always be combined with [filters](/docs/reference/javascript/using-filters) to target the item(s) you wish to delete.
      - If you use `delete()` with filters and you have
        [RLS](/docs/learn/auth-deep-dive/auth-row-level-security) enabled, only
        rows visible through `SELECT` policies are deleted. Note that by default
        no rows are visible, so you need at least one `SELECT`/`ALL` policy that
        makes the rows visible.
    examples:

      You can call stored procedures as a "Remote Procedure Call".

      That's a fancy way of saying that you can put some logic into your database then call it from anywhere.
      It's especially useful when the logic rarely changes - like password resets and updates.

    title: Using Filters

      Filters allow you to only return rows that match certain conditions.

      Filters can be used on `select()`, `update()`, and `delete()` queries.

    notes: |
      - `.or()` expects you to use the raw [PostgREST syntax](https://postgrest.org/en/stable/api.html#horizontal-filtering-rows) for the filter names and values.

        ```dart
        .or('id.in.(6,7),arraycol.cs.{"a","b"}')  // Use Postgres list () and 'in' for in_ filter. Array {} and 'cs' for contains.
        .or('id.in.(${mylist.join(',')}),arraycol.cs.{${mylistArray.join(',')}}') // You can insert a Dart list for list or array column.
        .or('id.in.(${mylist.join(',')}),rangecol.cs.(${mylistRange.join(',')}]') // You can insert a Dart list for list or range column.

          with advanced operators.

          - `unquoted text`: text not inside quote marks will be converted to terms separated by & operators, as if processed by plainto_tsquery.
          - `"quoted text"`: text inside quote marks will be converted to terms separated by <-> operators, as if processed by phraseto_tsquery.
          - `OR`: the word “or” will be converted to the | operator.
          - `-`: a dash will be converted to the ! operator.

    title: Using Modifiers
    description: |
      Filters work on the row level—they allow you to return rows that
      only match certain conditions without changing the shape of the rows.
      Modifiers are everything that don't fit that definition—allowing you to
      change the format of the response (e.g. returning a CSV string).

      Modifiers must be specified after filters. Some modifiers only apply for
      queries that return rows (e.g., `select()` or `rpc()` on a function that
      returns a table response).

    notes: |
      - By default, the user needs to verify their email address before logging in. To turn this off, disable **Confirm email** in [your project](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers).
      - **Confirm email** determines if users need to confirm their email address after signing up.
        - If **Confirm email** is enabled, a `user` is returned but `session` is null.
        - If **Confirm email** is disabled, both a `user` and a `session` are returned.
      - When the user confirms their email address, they are redirected to the [`SITE_URL`](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/auth/config#site_url) by default. You can modify your `SITE_URL` or add additional redirect URLs in [your project](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/url-configuration).
      - If signUp() is called for an existing confirmed user:
          - If **Confirm email** is enabled in [your project](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers), an obfuscated/fake user object is returned.
          - If **Confirm email** is disabled, the error message, `User already registered` is returned.
      - To fetch the currently logged-in user, refer to [`getUser()`](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-getuser).

    notes: |
      - Requires either an email or phone number.
      - This method is used for passwordless sign-ins where a OTP is sent to the user's email or phone number.
      - If the user doesn't exist, `signInWithOtp()` will signup the user instead. To restrict this behavior, you can set `shouldCreateUser` in `SignInWithPasswordlessCredentials.options` to `false`.
      - If you're using an email, you can configure whether you want the user to receive a magiclink or a OTP.
      - If you're using phone, you can configure whether you want the user to receive a OTP.
      - The magic link's destination URL is determined by the [`SITE_URL`](/docs/reference/auth/config#site_url).
      - See [redirect URLs and wildcards](/docs/guides/auth/overview#redirect-urls-and-wildcards) to add additional redirect URLs to your project.
      - Magic links and OTPs share the same implementation. To send users a one-time code instead of a magic link, [modify the magic link email template](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/templates) to include `{{ .Token }}` instead of `{{ .ConfirmationURL }}`.

          If you need additional data from an OAuth provider, you can include a space-separated list of scopes in your request to get back an OAuth provider token.
          You may also need to specify the scopes in the provider's OAuth app settings, depending on the provider. The list of scopes will be documented by the third-party provider you are using and specifying scopes will enable you to use the OAuth provider token to call additional APIs supported by the third-party provider to get more information.

    notes: |
      - The `verifyOtp` method takes in different verification types. If a phone number is used, the type can either be `sms` or `phone_change`. If an email address is used, the type can be one of the following: `signup`, `magiclink`, `recovery`, `invite` or `email_change`.
      - The verification type used should be determined based on the corresponding auth method called before `verifyOtp` to sign up / sign-in a user.
    examples:
      - id: verify-sms-one-time-password(otp)
        name: Verify Sms One-Time Password (OTP)

  - id: set-session
    title: 'setSession()'
    $ref: '@supabase/gotrue-js.GoTrueClient.setSession'
    notes: |
      - `setSession()` takes in a refresh token and uses it to get a new session.
      - The refresh token can only be used once to obtain a new session.
      - [Refresh token rotation](/docs/reference/auth/config#refresh_token_rotation_enabled) is enabled by default on all projects to guard against replay attacks.
      - You can configure the [`REFRESH_TOKEN_REUSE_INTERVAL`](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/auth/config#refresh_token_reuse_interval) which provides a short window in which the same refresh token can be used multiple times in the event of concurrency or offline issues.

    notes: |
      - Types of auth events: `SIGNED_IN`, `SIGNED_OUT`, `TOKEN_REFRESHED`, `USER_UPDATED`, `PASSWORD_RECOVERY`
      - Currently, `onAuthStateChange()` does not work across tabs.
      For instance, in the case of a password reset flow, the original tab which requested for the password reset link will not receive the `SIGNED_IN` and `PASSWORD_RECOVERY` event when the user clicks on the link.

      - Removing a channel is a great way to maintain the performance of your project's Realtime service as well as your database if you're listening to Postgres changes.
      - Supabase will automatically handle cleanup 30 seconds after a client is disconnected, but unused channels may cause degradation as more clients are simultaneously subscribed.
