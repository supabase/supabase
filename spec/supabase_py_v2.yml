      You can initialize a new Supabase client using the `create_client()` method.

      The Supabase client is your entrypoint to the rest of the Supabase functionality
      and is the easiest way to interact with everything we offer within the Supabase ecosystem.

    examples:
      - id: create-client
        name: create_client()
        code: |
          ```
          import os
          from supabase import create_client, Client

          url: str = os.environ.get("IECHOR_URL")
          key: str = os.environ.get("IECHOR_KEY")
          supabase: Client = create_client(url, key)
          ```
      - id: with-timeout-option
        name: With timeout option
        code: |
          ```
          import os
          from supabase import create_client, Client

          url: str = os.environ.get("IECHOR_URL")
          key: str = os.environ.get("IECHOR_KEY")
          supabase: Client = create_client(url, key, options={'timeout': 10})
          ```

  - id: sign-up
    title: 'sign_up()'
    notes: |
      - By default, the user needs to verify their email address before logging in. To turn this off, disable **Confirm email** in [your project](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers).
      - **Confirm email** determines if users need to confirm their email address after signing up.
        - If **Confirm email** is enabled, a `user` is returned but `session` is null.
        - If **Confirm email** is disabled, both a `user` and a `session` are returned.
      - By default, when the user confirms their email address, they are redirected to the [`SITE_URL`](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/auth/config#site_url). You can modify your `SITE_URL` or add additional redirect URLs in [your project](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/url-configuration).
      - If sign_up() is called for an existing confirmed user:
          - If **Confirm email** is enabled in [your project](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/providers), an obfuscated/fake user object is returned.
          - If **Confirm email** is disabled, the error message, `User already registered` is returned.
      - To fetch the currently logged-in user, refer to [`getUser()`](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-getuser).
    examples:
      - id: signup
        name: Sign up
        code: |
          ```
          res = supabase.auth.sign_up({
            "email": 'example@email.com',
            "password": 'example-password',
          })
          ```

        name: Sign up with additional user metadata
        code: |
          ```
          res = supabase.auth.sign_up({
            "email": 'example@email.com',
            "password": 'example-password',
            "options": {
              "data": {
                "first_name": 'John',

              }
            }
          })
          ```
  - id: sign-in-with-password
    title: 'sign_in_with_password'
    notes: |
      - Requires either an email and password or a phone number and password.
    examples:
      - id: sign-in-with-email-and-password
        name: Sign in with email and password
        isSpotlight: true
        code: |

          data = supabase.auth.sign_in_with_password({"phone": "+1234566", password": "testsupabasenow"})
          # After receiving a SMS with a OTP.
          data = supabase.auth.verify_otp({
            "phone": '+13334445555',
            "token": '123456',
          })
          ```
  - id: sign-in-with-otp
    title: 'sign_in_with_otp'
    notes: |
      - Requires either an email or phone number.
      - This method is used for passwordless sign-ins where a OTP is sent to the user's email or phone number.
      - If the user doesn't exist, `sign_in_with_otp()` will signup the user instead. To restrict this behavior, you can set `should_create_user` in `SignInWithPasswordlessCredentials.options` to `false`.
      - If you're using an email, you can configure whether you want the user to receive a magiclink or a OTP.
      - If you're using phone, you can configure whether you want the user to receive a OTP.
      - The magic link's destination URL is determined by the [`SITE_URL`](/docs/reference/auth/config#site_url).
      - See [redirect URLs and wildcards](/docs/guides/auth/overview#redirect-urls-and-wildcards) to add additional redirect URLs to your project.
      - Magic links and OTPs share the same implementation. To send users a one-time code instead of a magic link, [modify the magic link email template](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/templates) to include `{{ .Token }}` instead of `{{ .ConfirmationURL }}`.
    examples:
      - id: sign-in-with-email
        name: Sign in with email
        isSpotlight: true
        description: The user will be sent an email which contains either a magiclink or a OTP or both. By default, a given user can only request a OTP once every 60 seconds.
        code: |
          ```
          data = supabase.auth.sign_in_with_otp({
            "email": 'example@email.com',
            "options": {
              "email_redirect_to": 'https://example.com/welcome'
            }
          })
          ```

  - id: sign-in-with-oauth
    title: 'sign_in_with_oauth'
    notes: |
      - This method is used for signing in using a third-party provider.
      - Supabase supports many different [third-party providers](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth#providers).
    examples:
      - id: sign-in-using-a-third-party-provider
        name: Sign in using a third-party provider
        isSpotlight: true
        code: |
          ```
          data = supabase.auth.sign_in_with_oauth({
            "provider": 'github'
          })
          ```
      - id: sign-in-using-a-third-party-provider-with-redirect
        name: Sign in using a third-party provider with redirect
        isSpotlight: false
        description: |
          - When the third-party provider successfully authenticates the user, the provider redirects the user to the URL specified in the `redirectTo` parameter. This parameter defaults to the [`SITE_URL`](/docs/reference/auth/config#site_url). It does not redirect the user immediately after invoking this method.
          - See [redirect URLs and wildcards](/docs/guides/auth/overview#redirect-urls-and-wildcards) to add additional redirect URLs to your project.
        code: |
          ```
          data = supabase.auth.sign_in_with_oauth({
            "provider": 'github',
            "options": {
              "redirect_to": 'https://example.com/welcome'
            }
          })
          ```
      - id: sign-in-with-scopes
        name: Sign in with scopes
        isSpotlight: false
        description: |
          If you need additional data from an OAuth provider, you can include a space-separated list of scopes in your request to get back an OAuth provider token.
          You may also need to specify the scopes in the provider's OAuth app settings, depending on the provider. The list of scopes will be documented by the third-party provider you are using and specifying scopes will enable you to use the OAuth provider token to call additional APIs supported by the third-party provider to get more information.
        code: |
          ```
          data = supabase.auth.sign_in_with_oauth({
            "provider": 'github',
            "options": {
              "scopes": 'repo gist notifications'
            }
          })
          oauth_token = data.session.provider_token # use to access provider API
          ```
  - id: sign-out
    title: 'sign_out()'
    notes: |
      - In order to use the `signOut()` method, the user needs to be signed in first.
    examples:
      - id: sign-out
        name: Sign out
        code: |
          ```
          res = supabase.auth.sign_out()
          ```
  - id: verify-otp
    title: 'verify_otp'
    notes: |
      - The `verify_otp` method takes in different verification types. If a phone number is used, the type can either be `sms` or `phone_change`. If an email address is used, the type can be one of the following: `signup`, `magiclink`, `recovery`, `invite` or `email_change`.
      - The verification type used should be determined based on the corresponding auth method called before `verify_otp` to sign up / sign-in a user.
    examples:
      - id: verify-sms-one-time-password
        name: Verify SMS One-Time Password (OTP)
        code: |
          ```
          res = supabase.auth.verify_otp(phone, token)
          ```
  - id: get-user
    title: 'get_user'
    notes: |
      - This method gets the user object from the current session.
      - Fetches the user object from the database instead of local session.
    examples:
      - id: get-the-logged-in-user-with-the-current-existing-session
        name: Get the logged in user with the current existing session
        isSpotlight: true
        code: |
          ```
          data = supabase.auth.get_user()
          ```
      - id: get-the-logged-in-user-with-a-custom-access-token-jwt
        name: Get the logged in user with a custom access token jwt
        isSpotlight: false
        code: |
          ```
          data = supabase.auth.get_user(jwt)
          ```

  - id: get-session
    title: 'get_session'
    examples:
      - id: get-session
        name: Get the session data
        code: |
          ```
          res = supabase.auth.get_session()
          ```

  - id: set-session
    title: 'set_session()'
    notes: |
      - `setSession()` takes in a refresh token and uses it to get a new session.
      - The refresh token can only be used once to obtain a new session.
      - [Refresh token rotation](/docs/reference/auth/config#refresh_token_rotation_enabled) is enabled by default on all projects to guard against replay attacks.
      - You can configure the [`REFRESH_TOKEN_REUSE_INTERVAL`](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/auth/config#refresh_token_reuse_interval) which provides a short window in which the same refresh token can be used multiple times in the event of concurrency or offline issues.
      - If you are using React Native, you will need to install a Buffer polyfill via a library such as [rn-nodeify](https://github.com/tradle/rn-nodeify) to properly use the library.
    examples:
      - id: set-session
        name: Refresh the session
        description: Sets the session data from refresh_token and returns current session or an error if the refresh_token is invalid.
        code: |
          ```
          res = supabase.auth.set_session({"access_token": access_token, "refresh_token": refresh_token)
          ```
  - id: refresh-session
    title: 'refresh_session()'
    notes: |
      - This method will refresh the session whether the current one is expired or not.
      - Both examples destructure `user` and `session` from `data`. This is not required; so `const { data, error } =` is also valid.
    examples:
      - id: refresh-session
        name: Refresh session using the current session
        code: |
          ```
          res = supabase.auth.refresh_session()
          ```
  - id: select
    title: 'Fetch data: select()'
    notes: |
      - By default, Supabase projects return a maximum of 1,000 rows. This setting can be changed in your project's [API settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/api). It's recommended that you keep it low to limit the payload size of accidental or malicious requests.
      - `apikey` is a reserved keyword if you're using the [Supabase Platform](/docs/guides/platform) and [should be avoided as a column name](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/issues/5465).

      Invoke a Supabase Function.
    notes: |
      - Requires an Authorization header.
      - When you pass in a body to your function, we automatically attach the Content-Type header for `Blob`, `ArrayBuffer`, `File`, `FormData` and `String`. If it doesn't match any of these types we assume the payload is `json`, serialise it and attach the `Content-Type` header as `application/json`. You can override this behaviour by passing in a `Content-Type` header of your own.
