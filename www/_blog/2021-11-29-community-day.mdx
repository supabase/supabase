## Blog

Supabase combines existing open-source tools with our own open-source contributions to provide a delightful experience for developers. As part of this goal we hope to build a community of communities, bringing together developers from many different tools, as well as new developers looking to get involved with open source.

To kick off launch week we want to showcase some of the communities that make up the Supabase community, highlight some of their updates, and celebrate everyone who contributes their time to the Supabase mission. 

So let's get cracking, we've got a lot to cover. 🚀

## Open Source Spotlight: Kong API Gateway

Supabase provides a whole bunch of features that are made up of a [collection of open-source tools](https://supabase.com/docs/architecture). To orchestrate these different services and functionalities we use the [Kong API Gateway](https://github.com/Kong/kong).

As a user of our hosted offering you don't really need to know all this, but we love showcasing the amazing open-source tools that we work with, and so we've invited [Vik Gamov](https://twitter.com/gAmUssA) to give you a little intro to [Kong](https://github.com/Kong/kong):

[As you (hopefully) know](https://supabase.com/docs/learn/auth-deep-dive/auth-deep-dive-jwts#jwts-in-supabase), keeping your service role key secret is a crucial part of securing your database. But we also know that it can be difficult to make sure it stays secret as your team grows and you don't accidentally leak it. To help you with this, [we've partnered with GitGuardian](https://blog.gitguardian.com/the-detector-of-the-month-november-2021/).

GitGuardian helps developers keep 250+ types of secrets out of source code. Their automated secrets detection and remediation solution secures every step of the development life cycle, helping you monitor your code for sensitive data.

## Auth updates

![0auth-providers__twitter.jpg](/images/blog/launch-week-three/community-day/0auth-providers__twitter.jpg)

The beauty of building in the open is that the community can get involved in adding new OAuth providers, which is exactly what [@TheHarryET](https://twitter.com/TheHarryET) and [MonsterDeveloper](https://github.com/MonsterDeveloper) have been doing. Thanks to them you can now provide sign-in with [Slack](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-slack) as well as [Spotify](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-spotify) to your users, as well as use [MessageBird](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-messagebird) for phone auth as an alternative to the existing [Twilio](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-twilio) integration.

To celebrate this, we've created a [Supabase Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6FMx89EJjNHvjhy5auyZHx?si=e5ff6428415f420b) for y'all to blast out when reading our Launch Week posts, as well as when building with Supabase. Some top coding tunes in here! 📻

## SupaSquad updates

The [SupaSquad](https://supabase.com/docs/handbook/supasquad) is an official Supabase advocate program where community members help build and manage the Supabase community. 

Among many other awesome things, the SupaSquad has been absolutely on fire building [client libraries](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/supabase-client) for all flavors of backends and environments.

### Python client library updates

- New maintainers [`@Dreinon`](https://github.com/dreinon), [`@anand2312`](https://github.com/anand2312) and [`@leynier`](https://github.com/leynier). 💚
- Gotrue-py rewritten and now at feature parity with gotrue-js.
- Postgrest-py now support synchronous operations as well instead of just synchronous operations in the past. Also at feature-parity with postgrest-js.
- Supabase-py is now Supabase (e.g. you do `pip3 install supabase` instead of `pip3 install supabase-py`).
- Storage is working for the py client library but it's yet to be extracted out as a standalone lib.

## New tutorials and integration guides

Our own [Jon Meyers](https://twitter.com/_dijonmusters) and the broader community have been busy creating awesome tutorials and integration guides to help everyone build even more amazing things with Supabase. Jon has added official guides for working with [Auth0](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/integrations/auth0), [Draftbit](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/integrations/draftbit), [Prisma](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/integrations/prisma), and [Vercel](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/integrations/vercel)!

## User stories

Anytime we scroll through [https://www.madewithsupabase.com/](https://www.madewithsupabase.com/) we're absolutely blown away by the awesome things y'all are building with Supabase. 

So we've reached out to a couple of you to see if you'd be able to talk about how and what you're building with Supabase, and we've been overwhelmed by your gracious submissions! So we've started a user stories playlist and we are so excited to see many more of these stories in the future. 💚
