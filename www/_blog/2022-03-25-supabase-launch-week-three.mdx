By now you probably know the drill. Supabase Launch Week: we launch one thing, or sometimes a couple, 
every day for an entire week. 

If this is your first Launch Week, check out our previous Launch Weeks for a taste of what's to come:

- [Launch Week II: The SQL](https://supabase.com/blog/2021/07/22/supabase-launch-week-sql)
- [Launch Week III: The Trilogy](https://supabase.com/blog/2021/11/26/supabase-launch-week-the-trilogy)

## What to expect

Launch Week Four has something for everybody. 

We don't want to spoil the surprise, so for now we'll give you a teaser for each day.

### What

Finally, we're continuing our tradition of wrapping up Launch Week by rolling into a 10-day virtual Hackathon. 
As always, you'll have the chance to win extremely limited Supabase Swag, 
and you'll be able to play around with the new features we're about to launch.

We're also delighted to be partnering with [the future forest company](https://thefutureforestcompany.com/) 
to plant a tree for every project that is being submitted for the Hackathon. 
So let's build some cool open-source projects and a forest at the same time!

### When

Friday 1 April 2022: 9:00am PT - Sunday 9 April 11:59pm PT

### Where

We're extremely excited to see what you'll build and can't wait to dive into your submissions on 
[madewithsupabase.com](https://www.madewithsupabase.com/).
