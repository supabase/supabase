In March, Supabase held a [Launch Week](/blog/2021/03/25/launch-week) where we launched a new product/feature every day for a week.

In July we did [Launch Week II: The SQL](/blog/2021/07/22/supabase-launch-week-sql), with another week of feature releases.

Santa's little hackers have been hard at work because we've got another five days of launches ready to go.

We don't want to spoil the surprise, so for now we'll give you a teaser of what to expect.
