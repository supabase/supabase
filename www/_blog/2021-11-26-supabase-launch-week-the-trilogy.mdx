In March, Supabase held a [Launch Week](/blog/2021/03/25/launch-week) where we launched a new product/feature every day for a week.

In July we did [Launch Week II: The SQL](/blog/2021/07/22/supabase-launch-week-sql), with another week of feature releases.

Santa's little hackers have been hard at work because we've got another five days of launches ready to go.

## What to expect

We don't want to spoil the surprise, so for now we'll give you a teaser of what to expect.
