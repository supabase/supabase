Happy 2022. We're looking forward to a year of shipping product and helping our users build great things!

Here's a bunch of stuff we shipped throughout December...

## Hackathon Winners 

We had a ton of awesome projects submitted for our Holiday Hackdays, all of the submissions are open source so come and check out the code for some of our top picks!

## New crypto extension - pg_crypto

We just added pg_sodium as an extension inside all postgres instances. 
Which means you can easily do encryption, decryption, hashing, and cryptographic signing from within your postgres functions and queries. 
Enable it from the Database > Extensions tab in the Supabase Dashboard.

## PostgreSQL Videos 

### Call Postgres functions from JavaScript with RPC

Jon Meyers walks you through how to write more complex queries and logic in your database, and invoke it via the API.

### Call any API using PostgreSQL functions 

We recently added the ability to call any external HTTP endpoint from your postgres functions. Jon shows you how!
