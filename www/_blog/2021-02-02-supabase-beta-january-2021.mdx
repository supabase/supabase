New year, new features. We've been busy at Supabase during January and our community has been even busier. Here's a few things you'll find interesting.

### Count functionality

Anyone who has worked with Firebase long enough has become frustrated over the [lack](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49979714/how-to-get-count-of-documents-in-a-collection) of `count` functionality. This isn't a problem with PostgreSQL! Our libraries now have support for PostgREST's [exact](https://postgrest.org/en/v7.0.0/api.html?highlight=count#exact-count), [planned](https://postgrest.org/en/v7.0.0/api.html?highlight=count#planned-count), and [estimated](https://postgrest.org/en/v7.0.0/api.html?highlight=count#estimated-count) counts. A massive thanks to [@dshukertjr](https://github.com/supabase/postgrest-js/issues/94#event-4210564301) for this adding support to our client library.

### New Auth Providers

We enabled 2 new Auth providers - Facebook and Azure. Thanks to [@Levet](https://github.com/supabase/gotrue/pull/54) for the Azure plugin, and once again to [Netlify's amazing work](https://github.com/netlify/gotrue/issues/107) with GoTrue to implement Facebook.

### Auth Audit Trail

We have exposed the audit trail directly in the dashboard, as well as the GoTrue logs. Great for security and debugging.

### Auth UI widget

In case our Auth endpoints aren't easy enough already, we've built a React [Auth Widget](http://ui.supabase.com/?path=/story/auth-auth--default) for you to drop into your app and to get up-and-running in minutes.

### New `auth.email()` function

We added a helper function for extracting the logged in user's email address.

### New Regions

Launch your database in London or Sydney!

### Copy rows as Markdown

You can now copy SQL results as Markdown - super useful for adding to blogs and issues.

### React server components

If you're excited by React Server components then check out the Supabase + Server Components experimental repo. [https://github.com/supabase/next-server-components](https://github.com/supabase/next-server-components)

### Learn

We know that Auth can be a bit daunting when you're just starting out, so we have created some intro videos to get you up to speed in no time:

- [Supabase Auth Deep Dive Part 1: JWTs](https://youtu.be/v3Exg5YpJvE)
- [Supabase Auth Deep Dive Part 2: Restrict Table Access](https://youtu.be/qY_iQ10IUhs)
- [Supabase Auth Deep Dive Part 3: User Based Access Policies](https://youtu.be/0LvCOlELs5U)

### Kaizen

- Performance: We migrated all of our subdomains to Route53, implementing custom Let's Encrypt certs for your APIs. As a result, our read benchmarks are measuring up 12% faster.
- Performance: We upgrade your databases to the new [GP3](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/12/introducing-new-amazon-ebs-general-purpose-volumes-gp3/) storage for faster and more consistent throughput.
