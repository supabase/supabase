When we joined Y Combinator last summer, we spent the entire 3-month program building one (major) feature: Auth. 

Demo Day gave our team something to rally around. The looming deadline forced us to deliver a lot of complex functionality in a short amount of time.

After we finished YC, we recreated Demo Day conditions internally: we gave ourselves a 3-month timeline to move from Alpha to Beta. 

It worked wonders. We made [giant leaps forward](https://supabase.io/beta) in the performance, security, and 
stability of the platform.

The day after our Beta announcement (still high on the adrenaline of the launch) we asked ourselves: 
what's the most ambitious thing we can hope to launch 3 months from now?

We decided not to settle for just one major feature. We wanted to fill an entire week with launches and announcements. 

Looking at the list of features we planned, and with the relatively small team we have, this felt like a hugely ambitious idea. 
But after another 3 months of building, we're happy to announce that...

Starting on Monday 29th March, we'll be commencing our Launch Week!


## What to expect

We don't want to spoil the surprise, so for now we'll give you a teaser of what to expect. Come back here each day to see what we launch, 
or follow us on twitter to keep up to date: [@supabase_io](https://twitter.com/supabase_io) and follow the hashtag [#supalaunchweek](https://twitter.com/hashtag/supalaunchweek).

## Monday: Pricing

- 29 March 2021

We're announcing pricing today. If you don’t care for the details, [here is the pricing](https://supabase.io/pricing).

The [blog post here](https://supabase.io/blog/2021/03/29/pricing) goes into depth around our decision-making process.

The key takeaway is that we will stick with (what we feel is) a generous free tier. This was critical for many of our users who are still in the “build” phase of their project/business.

Another key takeaway is predictability. We’ve talked to too many devs who have been caught out by Firebase’s usage billing.

Usually this is due to rogue API requests, which have a habit of spiking without any good debugging tools. To circumvent this, our usage pricing is centered on more “predictable” mechanisms (like storage), avoiding usage-billing on items like API requests.

Even on our free tier you’re able to make millions of requests per day (we have developers doing this already!). In the future we will introduce “usage caps” on our top tier, which will allow you to specify maximum spends. Finally, we’re starting with soft-tiers, so nobody will be “unexpectedly” upgraded.

We’re a startup ourselves, so we want to build a sustainable business. Even though we are offering a free tier, we’re confident in our ability to support it long-term with the enterprise features we are building (SSO, multi-cloud).

If you aren’t confident in our business model though, we’re open source. You can [host it yourself](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/tree/master/docker). Even better, everything we build is centered around Postgres, so you can pretty much `pgdump` your database and take it to your favourite Postgres platform.
