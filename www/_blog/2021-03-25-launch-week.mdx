When we joined Y Combinator last summer, we spent the entire 3-month program building one (major) feature: Auth. 

Demo Day gave our team something to rally around. The looming deadline forced us to deliver a lot of complex functionality in a short amount of time.

After we finished YC, we recreated Demo Day conditions internally: we gave ourselves a 3-month timeline to move from Alpha to Beta. 

It worked wonders. We made [giant leaps forward](https://supabase.io/beta) in the performance, security, and 
stability of the platform.

The day after our Beta announcement (still high on the adrenaline of the launch) we asked ourselves: 
what's the most ambitious thing we can hope to launch 3 months from now?

We decided not to settle for just one major feature. We wanted to fill an entire week with launches and announcements. 

Looking at the list of features we planned, and with the relatively small team we have, this felt like a hugely ambitious idea. 
But after another 3 months of building, we're happy to announce that...

Starting on Monday 29th March, we'll be commencing our Launch Week!
