When we joined YCombinator last summer, we spent most of the 3 month program building one major feature: Auth. 

Demo Day gave our team something to rally around. The looming deadline forced us to deliver a lot of complex functionality in a short amount of time.

After we finished YC, we decided to recreate Demo Day conditions internally, giving ourselves a 3 month timeline to move from alpha to beta. 

This artificial deadline worked wonders. We made [giant leaps forward](https://supabase.io/beta) in the performance, security, and stability of the platform and our growth figures reflected the hard work we'd put in.

The day after our beta announcement, still high on the adrenaline of the launch, we met together with the team and asked ourselves: what is the most ambitious thing we can hope to launch 3 months from now?

We decided that we wouldn't settle for just one or two major features. We planned to fill an entire week with product launches and announcements. 

Looking at the list of planned features, and with the relatively small team we have, this felt like a hugely ambitious idea. But after another 3 months of building, we're happy to announce that...

Starting on Monday 29th March, we'll be commencing our Launch Week!
