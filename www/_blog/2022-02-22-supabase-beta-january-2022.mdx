This month's beta update is more stacked than the Superbowl (Supa-bowl\*) halftime show. Here’s all of the highlights from January...

## New OAuth providers

We’re continually amazed by how quickly new auth providers are being added into Supabase, and last month, 2 more have been added.

## New SMS providers

Along with the new 0Auth providers above, last month saw the addition of two more SMS phone providers to allow you to authenticate users via an SMS OTP (One-Time Password) token.

**[Vonage](https://www.vonage.com/)**
An american based cloud communications provider

**[Textlocal](https://www.textlocal.com/)**
We are now fulfilling a popular request with this Indian compliant SMS provider
Also added by **[devkiran](https://github.com/devkiran)**

And just a reminder if you don’t already know, we also have support for [Twilio](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-twilio) and [MessageBird](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-messagebird).

Also, on a final note on Auth, you may have already heard, we are hiring for an [Auth Engineer](https://about.supabase.com/careers/auth-engineers).

## Query logs with SQL

Our logs are getting more powerful, now with the [newly added SQL querying](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/pull/4734), implemented by our very own [Ziinc](https://github.com/Ziinc), who joined Supabase only a few weeks ago.

Not only that, we’ve added [Timestamp filtering](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/pull/4904), and you’ll notice our usage charts [have more time spans available](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/pull/4732) now.

We’re really excited about how we can enable developers to quickly diagnose their projects with powerful logging and observability tools so, as cliché as it sounds, watch this space for more.

## GraphQL v0.1.0

![Graph QL v0.1.0](/images/blog/2022-january/pg_graphql_0.1.0_monthly-email-dec-2021.png)

[`pg_graphql`](https://github.com/supabase/pg_graphql) development is in full-swing. Last month we released v0.1.0, which includes [Comment Directives](https://supabase.github.io/pg_graphql/configuration/#comment-directives).

We haven’t released GraphQL onto the platform yet, because we are still developing and testing; but, rest assured, watch this space!

Example

```sql
create table account(
    id serial primary key
);

comment on table public.account is
e'@graphql({ "name": "AccountHolder" })';

```

Result

```jsx
// Renames "Account" to "AccountHolder"
type AccountHolder {
  id: Int!
}
```

## New examples

**Remix Auth**

[It’s all anyone seems to talk about](https://twitter.com/jkup/status/1456360115205033989), and we genuinely love what [Remix](https://remix.run/) has been doing, so it’s only right we have an example app.

\*\*\*\*[Check out the new Remix Auth example](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/tree/master/examples/remix-auth), and let us know what you think.

**Expo Todo List**

Our React Native example has been correctly updated to be an Expo example.

[Check it out here](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/tree/master/examples/expo-todo-list), let us know what you think.

## New Video: API requests with Function Hooks

It seems there is no stopping [Jon Meyers](https://jonmeyers.io/videos)! He’s back already with an [in-depth video on how to easily automate API requests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=codAs9-NeHM&feature=emb_title) using our very own Function Hooks.

Learn how to listen to _any_ change in your database, then send those changes [in a payload](https://supabase.com/blog/2021/07/30/supabase-functions-updates#hook-payload) via HTTP request. The payload includes the data before _and_ after it changed.

## Set your own support ticket priority

If you didn’t already know, we have a dedicated support form that goes straight to our support inbox. We’ve been drastically improving internal processes to quicken response times and, more importantly, solve your problems faster.

We know sometimes there can be the odd glitch and you really need to us how important it is, so we thought it would make sense that _you_ could set the priority of your support tickets.

We also have extra “urgent” levels that can be selected for the PRO and Pay As You Go projects.

And, as part of our continued commitment to Support, we are hiring [Support Engineers](https://about.supabase.com/careers/support-and-qa). If you think you’ve got what it takes, we want to hear from you. If you know of others who might be interested, please forward that link across your social accounts.

## Community

As always, the community has been amazing, so it’s hard to keep up with what’s going on; but let’s try and summarize what happened last month.

### Supabase + Snaplet

Lots of you ask about maintaining multiple environments. Snaplet helps you copy a production database and clone it into different environments.

Check out the [Supabase clone environments](https://docs.snaplet.dev/tutorials/supabase-clone-environments) tutorial, and check out the video below.

### Supabase + Retool

Retool has put together a brilliant 10 minute admin panel setup using Supabase with Retool.

Check out the video below.

### Learn with Jason

Jason Lengstorf managed to catch up with our very own [Jon Meyers](https://jonmeyers.io/) on his awesome show, [Learn with Jason](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vqY1KT4TLU), to talk about building an app [with Supabase and NextJS](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/with-nextjs).

### New article highlights

- Arctype published a new guide showing how to connect to your Supabase database [https://arctype.com/postgres/connect/supabase-postgres](https://arctype.com/postgres/connect/supabase-postgres)
- https://github.com/marmelab/ra-supabase, Supabase adapter for react-admin, the frontend framework for building admin applications on top of REST/GraphQL services.
- [~~https://hotgluexyz.notion.site/Supabase-and-hotglue-article-9e7f5583d27c419490ee7d536d6d269d](https://www.notion.so/Supabase-and-hotglue-article-9e7f5583d27c419490ee7d536d6d269d) (we can give them feedback on when we want this to be released)~~

### PostgREST

One of Supabase’s key tools that allow a lot of our functionality has had some updates.

- pg_listen was removed in favor of PostgREST’s built-in schema reloading https://github.com/supabase/infrastructure/issues/1531
  - Also results in performance improvements because PostgREST only reloads the schema cache—it no longer cycles the connection pool. (or something connection pool - Steve can expound further if needed)
- postgrest db connection pool size gets scaled with instance size for better performance for certain workload shapes.

## Coming Next: Launch Week IV

In what seems to be the worst kept secret in developer tools, prep for launch week 4 is in full development at Supabase. We’re now a much larger team, spanning even more disciplines and skills. That in mind, we really are supa-ecstatic for what will happen in the next launch week.

Of course, we can’t tell you what will happen (perhaps maybe we don’t even know yet); but you can always speculate in the community [Discord server](https://discord.supabase.com/), or even [tweet us your predictions](https://twitter.com/supabase).
