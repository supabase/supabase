In March, Supabase held a [Launch Week](/blog/2021/03/25/launch-week) where we launched a new product/feature every day for a week.

It may seem crazy to do another launch week just four months later, but we couldn't give up on a good pun, so get ready for **Launch Week II: the SQL**.

## What to expect

Just like last time, we don't want to spoil the surprise. So for now we'll give you a teaser of what to expect. Come back each day to see what we launch, or follow us on Twitter to keep up to date: [@supabase](https://twitter.com/supabase) and follow the hashtag [#supalaunchweek](https://twitter.com/hashtag/supalaunchweek).

## Monday 26 July: Community Day

### **When?**

Monday 26 July 2021.

### What?

One of the best things about building Supabase is the community. We're even luckier because we're an amalgamation of tools like Postgres and PostgREST. We're starting the week by shining a spotlight on some of the latest developments from the community.

### **When?**

Wednesday 28 July 2021.[^1]

### What?

What's cooler than Arnie in the 90's? Passwordless logins. We've [already](/docs/guides/auth/auth-apple) [built](/docs/guides/auth/auth-bitbucket) [support](/docs/guides/auth/auth-discord) [for](/docs/guides/auth/auth-facebook) [eight](/docs/guides/auth/auth-github) [different](/docs/guides/auth/auth-gitlab) [Oauth](/docs/guides/auth/auth-google) [providers](/docs/guides/auth/auth-twitter), so it's anyone's guess what can happen in Supabase Auth Episode II.
