Did you know that Supabase has been one of the fastest growing startups [on GitHub](https://github.com/supabase/supabase) for four consecutive quarters? [^1]

This simply be possible without some amazing open source tools, and since we're shipping a few upgrades this week we feel it's only fair 
to shine a spotlight on some of the tools and community efforts that make Supabase possible. 

## PostgreSQL version 13.3

![Postgres version 13 released](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/9c581252-6e87-4ab4-a6cd-66bfe3eec6d0/supabase-postgres-13.png)


PostgreSQL is not only a huge part of Supabase, it's also a huge inspiration - the speed that they ship, their community organization, 
and their absolute dedication towards reliability. PostgreSQL 13.3 was released in June and from today, every new Supabase project will 
be on PostgreSQL version 13.3.

### Giving back

Supabase makes it easy to get started with Postgres, but we think you should try it even if you don't want to use Supabase. Here's a 
few ways that we want to give back to the PostgreSQL community:

- Supabase was the first company to put Postgres in the [Digital Ocean Marketplace](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/supabase-postgres). 
Since then it's been installed over 1000 times (not by us!).
- We provide the same image in the [AWS marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-lk2pfa5nafecg).
- We're packaging the Marketplace version, along with "Bundles" [link to the blog post]
- We're developing a few extensions: `[supautils](https://github.com/supabase/supautils)` and `[pg_net](https://github.com/supabase/pg_net)`

## PostgREST version 8.0

![PostgREST version 8.0 released](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/7136a514-55ab-428c-b8da-638a6cba1e5f/supabase-postgrest.png)

This new PostgREST stable version comes with the improvements we've made to make it truly enterprise-grade. Due to our commitment with OSS, 
all of our improvements are upstreamed, so you can fully use them on your own self-hosted projects.

### Highlights

**Improved Performance**: Supabase's high throughput requirements made this PostgREST version be able to handle up to 50% more throughput on 
GET requests according to our benchmarks. We converted all of its SELECT queries to use prepared statements and reduced its logging 
verbosity to make this possible.

**Reduced downtime**: we need PostgREST to be more "set it and forget it", so reloading its schema cache is now zero downtime.

**Dynamic Configuration**: we've made it easier to handle PostgREST configuration at scale(we manage hundreds of PostgREST instances). 
This new version includes the ability to use an in-database configuration that is reloadable through a NOTIFY command.

**Less admin burden**: PostgREST used to require the `pg_listen` utility to reload its schema cache. This is no longer needed. 
The schema cache is reloadable with a simple NOTIFY command.

**Better diagnostic information**: in the rare cases where PostgREST fails, we want to find the exact root cause quickly. 
For this we've improved its logging by adding logging levels and timestamps to its server errors.

**Simpler OpenAPI**: showing a complete OpenAPI output used to require a highly-privileged `anon` role. With the new `openapi-mode`, 
this is no longer needed and `anon` can be kept with minimal privileges.

The community has also made more enhancements and many bug fixes for the new version, see the 
[v8.0 CHANGELOG](https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest/releases/tag/v8.0.0) for the full list.

While the Supabase team have been busy with the Javascript libraries, the community have been beavering away with Dart. They've even 
[built fully-functional apps](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/spot-2d300f54-7a0a-4dbf-aee2-4a75311217cc) using Supabase Auth and Storage. 

Today the Community are releasing both the the Flutter and Dart libraries in Beta.

## Supabase Discord

![Supabase Discord](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/406cbb95-1152-4b77-9377-e1304c956000/supabase-discord.png)

OK, OK, we get it - GitHub [Discussions](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/discussions) aren't enough for y'all. While we've been trying 
to keep the conversation contained to our GitHub, the community has been creating [subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/Supabase/), 
StackOverflow [tags](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/supabase), and GitHub [topics](https://github.com/topics/supabase). 

A few weeks ago one of the community decided to create a Community-led Discord, and so the team figured we might as well join the fun.

We'll still be using Discussions for debugging, but if you're looking for a Supabase Social, Discord is where to find it.

### Get involved

Join the Supabase Community Discord: [https://discord.gg/AYybku5cUz](https://discord.gg/AYybku5cUz), say hi, and start building.
