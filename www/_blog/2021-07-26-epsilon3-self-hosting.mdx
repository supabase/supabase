Epsilon3 are a USA based Y-Combinator backed startup leveraging telemetry data to digitise paper based procedures for complex
testing and operations. Their product is rapidly becoming the OS for space projects and complex operations.

Learn how the team at Epsilon3 use Supabase to help teams execute secure and reliable operations in an industry that
project spend runs into the billions.

### Space Operations

Epsilon3 are modernising the industry by leveraging telemetry data to digitise paper procedures in space operations.
Their customers need to run testing and operational procedures in real time. Using Epsilon3's solution means people can
collaborate online as a team instead of being siloed and separated, an increasingly important requirement in a post-pandemic working world.
Epsilon3 are powering an industry where reliability is a must. In the space industry missions cost billions and need to run reliably.

The stakes are high when working on projects where failure entails huge potential financial losses. Epsilon3's software saves
operators time and reduces errors to improve complex operations. Their customers are already using their software and successfully
sending satellites into space, and are about to use Epsilon3's software for an operational Rocket Launch. As a result, their
software reputation for improving the quality standard for complex operations has led to demand from other industries.
The team now have enquiries from clients in the robotics, logistics and medical equipment sectors who need a structured and standardised
way of running procedures and keeping audit trails.

**Moving fast in regulated markets**

The team has a background in engineering from Northrop, Google, and SpaceX and understand the technical benefits Postgres offers as a
battle tested open-source relational database.

Whilst the team know they want to use Postgres, they also understand setting up a scalable back-end takes time and must be maintained.
Realtime functionality is also a key for their customers so they can see how running procedures are progressing in real time.

As a startup, Epsilon3 need to move fast AND scale. They require security, reliability, and performance.

The space industry is highly regulated adding complexity. For example, in the USA deployments must be in an ITAR-compliant way like AWS
GovCloud while customers in countries outside the USA may need to host their data within their own country.
This means that Epsilon3 must be able to offer flexible hosting options, including on premises deployment.

    We didnâ€™t just want something that works, we wanted a solution implementing best practices. We
    also needed a setup that we could self-host to meet compliance needs and allow on-premises
    deployment options for our customers.

    We use Supabase because they give us an open-source scalable back-end built by database experts
    that we can self-host.

    Supabase takes out the mental effort from our back-end infrastructure so we can focus on our
    customers needs.

**Supabase gives Postgres users Supa-powers**

The team implemented a self hosted Supabase setup. For a customer in production in the USA this means they can use AWS infrastructure with
the Supabase API powering an RDS Postgres instance. This gives the perfect balance of rapid development, reduced DevOps, and flexible hosting
options - crucial for their customers. As Supabase uniquely offers realtime for Postgres they are able to allow their customers to see updates
from running procedures. Supabase also offers well supported client libraries that make row level security easy to use, which is crucial for the
Epsilon3 team to deliver on their future roadmap. Finally all this is easy and fast for the team to set up, even when self hosting which means
the team can focus on what they do best - helping their customers run complex operations smoothly.

With this implementation Epsilon3 get all the benefits of Postgres plus the smooth developer experience and support that Supabase is known for,
without making compromises to meet compliance needs.

### Self-hosted Supabase, a superpower

Self-hosting Supabase means the crew at Epsilon3 are able to move fast to revolutionise space operations securely and reliably in realtime
whilst staying compliant. The team are now seeing demand from other industries and are confident in their scaling capability because
they know it's just Postgres under the hood. Check out the Epsilon3 website to learn more about the team and their OS for space operations.
