Today is the 1st of April, or April Fool’s Day, but I like to think of today as Supabase Realtime Day where we announce and demo the next version of Realtime.

Here's the next version of Realtime, with multiplayer features.

We’ve made quite a few iterations on Realtime in the past. The first major version of Realtime listened to a single database by streaming changes from PostgreSQL’s Write-Ahead Log and sending them to clients via WebSockets. The second major version introduced better security via WALRUS (Write Ahead Log Realtime Unified Security) which adheres to a database’s RLS policies to determine authorized clients. However, this version continues to be single tenant as it can only poll one database at a time.

The next and third major version, announced today on new Supabase Realtime Day, introduces multi-tenancy to listen to many databases. Additionally, this new version introduces a distributed cluster of nodes, which introduces better resource utilization, fault-tolerance, and lower latencies that directly translates to better performance for developers. We’re fortunate to have built Realtime on Elixir and Phoenix, as the language and framework are great for concurrency, distributed computing, and WebSockets. We’ll continue to support the existing Realtime feature of listening to database changes, but now we’re also introducing the ability for developers to use WebSockets to build multiplayer games, collaborative apps, and support a wide array of use cases.

## New Features

### Presence

![realtime-multiplayer-presence.png](/images/blog/launch-week-4/friday-realtime/realtime-multiplayer-presence.png)

- CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Type) on a distributed cluster useful for storing synced data across nodes
- Showing when users are online
- When a user disconnects (even accidentally!), the server automatically detects this and let’s everyone else know

### Broadcast

![realtime-multiplayer-broadcast.png](/images/blog/launch-week-4/friday-realtime/realtime-multiplayer-broadcast.png)

- Clients can communicate with other clients by subscribing/publishing to topics
- Great for ephemeral events like cursor movements

### Extensions
- We’re re-architecting the way that we listen to PostgreSQL databases to open up WebSocket functionality for general use
  - Instead of only using WebSockets to broadcast database changes, we are now moving the PostgreSQL listener to an “extension” architecture
- Ideas
  - Developer can listen to multiple PostgreSQL databases at the same time
    - Listen to database changes from other databases
  - Finance: Listen to stock market events and broadcast them
  - Web3: Listen to blockchain events and broadcast them
  - A server clock which broadcasts a timer to every connected client (e.g. auction sites)

## Demo

[multiplayer.dev](https://multiplayer.dev)

- Built with Phoenix Web Framework, Next.js, and the next version of Supabase Realtime
- Deployed on a [Fly.io](https://fly.io) cluster of 20 nodes distributed around the world

## Roadmap

- Continue development and perform benchmarks of the next version of Supabase Realtime
- Invite developers and other interested parties from the waitlist to use the new version
  - You can sign up for the waitlist at [multiplayer.dev](https://multiplayer.dev)

You can follow development in our [open source repository on GitHub](https://github.com/supabase/realtime/tree/multiplayer).
