Today is the 1st of April, or April Fool’s Day, but I like to think of today as Supabase Realtime Day where we announce and demo the next version of Realtime.

Here's the next version of Realtime, with multiplayer features.

## New Features

### Presence

![realtime-multiplayer-presence.png](/images/blog/launch-week-4/friday-realtime/realtime-multiplayer-presence.png)

- CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Type) on a distributed cluster useful for storing synced data across nodes
- Showing when users are online
- When a user disconnects (even accidentally!), the server automatically detects this and let’s everyone else know

### Broadcast

![realtime-multiplayer-broadcast.png](/images/blog/launch-week-4/friday-realtime/realtime-multiplayer-broadcast.png)

- Clients can communicate with other clients by subscribing/publishing to topics
- Great for ephemeral events like cursor movements

### Extensions
- We’re re-architecting the way that we listen to PostgreSQL databases to open up WebSocket functionality for general use
  - Instead of only using WebSockets to broadcast database changes, we are now moving the PostgreSQL listener to an “extension” architecture
- Ideas
  - Developer can listen to multiple PostgreSQL databases at the same time
    - Listen to database changes from other databases
  - Finance: Listen to stock market events and broadcast them
  - Web3: Listen to blockchain events and broadcast them
  - A server clock which broadcasts a timer to every connected client (e.g. auction sites)

## Demo

[multiplayer.dev](https://multiplayer.dev)

- Built with Phoenix Web Framework, Next.js, and the next version of Supabase Realtime
- Deployed on a [Fly.io](https://fly.io) cluster of 20 nodes distributed around the world

## Roadmap

- Continue development and perform benchmarks of the next version of Supabase Realtime
- Invite developers and other interested parties from the waitlist to use the new version
  - You can sign up for the waitlist at [multiplayer.dev](https://multiplayer.dev)

You can follow development in our [open source repository on GitHub](https://github.com/supabase/realtime/tree/multiplayer).
