  },
  {
    "question": "What are soft limits? ",
    "answer": "Soft limits mean if you cross your usage tier we will let you know and give you a grace period without charging you for exceeding your limits.

If you do not respond, or do want to move up a tier and continue to exceed your limits then we may have to limit your projects consumption."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I know which tier I need before I even finish building my project?",

  },
  {
    "question": "If I exceed my limits, do I just get charged \"Overage\" for the items I use?",
    "answer": "We have soft limits so we will reach out if you exceed resource limits on the Pro Tier. Your project plan will need to move to the Usage based pricing before we charge any usage pricing. We will work with you in advance to understand your project cost forecasts."
