  },
  {
    "question": "What are soft limits? ",
    "answer": "Soft limits mean if you cross your usage tier we will let you know and give you a grace period without charging you for exceeding your limits. We will email you to discuss moving up a tier and you will not be charged until you agree to move up a tier. If you do not respond, or do not want to move up a tier and continue to exceed your limits then we may have to limit your projects' consumption."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I know which tier I need before I even finish building my project?",

    "answer": "We have a soft limits policy so if you do run over we will reach out to you with a grace period for you to make a decision on your project and upgrading a tier. This means your project will remain live and you will not automatically be billed more."
  },
  {
    "question": "If I exceed my limits, do I just get charged \"Overage\" for the items I use?",
    "answer": "We have soft limits so we will reach out if you exceed resource limits on the Pro Tier. Your project plan will need to move to the Usage based pricing before we charge any usage pricing. We will work with you in advance to understand your project cost forecasts."
