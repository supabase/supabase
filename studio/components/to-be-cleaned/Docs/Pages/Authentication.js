            If no <code>Authorization</code> header is included, the API will assume that you are
            making a request with an anonymous user.
          </p>
          <p>
            If an <code>Authorization</code> header is included, the API will "switch" to the role
            of the user making the request. See the User Management section for more details.

            Client keys allow "anonymous access" to your database, until the user has logged in.
            After logging in the keys will switch to the user's own login token.

            In this documentation, we will refer to the key using the name <code>SUPABASE_KEY</code>

            We have provided you a Client Key to get started. You will soon be able to add as many
            keys as you like. You can find the <code>anon</code> key in the{' '}

          <h4 className="mt-8">Realtime Security</h4>
          <p>
            Realtime server broadcasts database changes to authorized users depending on your Row Level Security (RLS) policies.
            We recommend that you enable row level security and set row security policies on tables that you add to the publication.
            However, you may choose to disable RLS on a table and have changes broadcast to all connected clients.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can get started by running{' '}
            <code>
              begin; drop publication if exists supabase_realtime; create publication
              supabase_realtime; commit;
            </code>
            . This creates a publication which is not subscribed to any table and completely
            disables Realtime on the Supabase client. Then, you can add any table from your `public` schema and
            changes will be broadcast accordingly.

            Service keys have FULL access to your data, bypassing any security policies. Be VERY
            careful where you expose these keys. They should only be used on a server and never on a
            client or browser.
