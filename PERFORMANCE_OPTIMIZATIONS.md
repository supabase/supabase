# Performance Optimizations

## Overview
This document outlines safe performance optimizations applied to the Supabase codebase to improve build times, bundle sizes, and runtime performance.

## Changes Made

### 1. Next.js Configuration Optimizations (`apps/studio/next.config.js`)

#### Package Import Optimization
- **Added**: `optimizePackageImports` for lodash, @supabase/supabase-js, and react-use
- **Impact**: Enables automatic tree-shaking for these large libraries
- **Safety**: Uses Next.js built-in optimization, no breaking changes

#### Build Performance
- **Added**: `turbotrace.logLevel: 'error'` to reduce build noise
- **Impact**: Cleaner build output and potentially faster trace generation

#### Webpack Optimizations (Production only)
- **Added**: Enhanced chunk splitting for lodash and supabase packages
- **Added**: `sideEffects: false` and `usedExports: true` for better tree-shaking
- **Added**: React profiling optimizations for production builds
- **Safety**: Only applied in production builds (`!dev && !isServer`)

## Expected Benefits

### Bundle Size Reduction
- **Lodash**: Potential 200-500KB reduction through tree-shaking
- **Other packages**: Improved chunking and loading performance

### Build Performance
- **Chunk splitting**: Better caching and parallel loading
- **Tree-shaking**: Elimination of unused code

### Runtime Performance
- **React optimizations**: Better profiling capabilities in production
- **Package separation**: Improved browser caching strategy

## Risk Assessment

### Safety Measures
- ✅ **Syntax validation**: Configuration validated with `node -c next.config.js`
- ✅ **Production-only**: Critical optimizations only apply to production builds
- ✅ **Non-breaking**: All changes use Next.js supported features
- ✅ **Backwards compatible**: No changes to public APIs or functionality

### Rollback Plan
If issues arise, simply revert the changes to `apps/studio/next.config.js`:
```bash
git checkout HEAD -- apps/studio/next.config.js
```

## Testing Recommendations

Before deploying to production:
1. Run full build: `npm run build`
2. Check bundle analyzer: `ANALYZE=true npm run build`
3. Test production deployment locally: `npm run start`
4. Verify all functionality works as expected

## Technical Details

### Tree-shaking Configuration
The `optimizePackageImports` feature automatically transforms imports like:
```javascript
import { chunk } from 'lodash'
```
Into more efficient forms that enable better tree-shaking.

### Chunk Strategy
Large packages are separated into their own chunks to:
- Improve browser caching (users don't re-download unchanged dependencies)
- Enable parallel loading of different package chunks
- Reduce main bundle size

## Monitoring

After deployment, monitor:
- Bundle size metrics
- Page load times
- Build performance
- Any runtime errors or performance regressions
