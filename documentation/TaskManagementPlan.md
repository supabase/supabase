# Task Management Plan for Long-Running Sessions

## 1. Purpose
This document defines a strategy to ensure continuity in task management when session context is lost due to exceeding the context window. It explains how to split tasks into discrete sessions, archive progress, and utilize version control effectively.

## 2. Documented Checkpoints
- **Session Checkpoints:**  
  At the end of each session, a checkpoint will be created that summarizes:
  - The tasks completed during the session.
  - Pending tasks for the next session.
  - Any relevant configuration or settings modifications.
- **Task Progress Logs:**  
  Log all changes in a dedicated task log file (TaskProgress.log) that will be committed to the repository. This log should include timestamps, descriptions of changes, and any issues encountered.

## 3. Version Control Integration
- **Commit Guidelines:**  
  Use explicit commit messages such as "Checkpoint: Completed task X; pending task Y." This allows the system to always have a retrievable history.
- **Branching Strategy:**  
  For major sessions or features, use dedicated branches. Merge changes into the main branch (ADS-BaaS) after verification.
- **Persistent Documentation:**  
  The TaskManagementPlan.md and TaskProgress.log files will live in the repository so that potential context loss can be mitigated by retrieving branch history.

## 4. Task Splitting and Session Continuity
- **Breaking Down Tasks:**
  - Each high-level objective (e.g., forking the repository, updating docker-compose, integrating AWS services) is subdivided into subtasks.
  - Identify critical milestones that can be checkpointed.
- **Session Breakpoints:**  
  - Define natural breakpoints after which current work is committed.
  - Write a summary in the TaskProgress.log at each breakpoint.
  - Store the state of configuration files (.env, docker-compose.yml, etc.) in dedicated snapshots if needed.
- **Handling Exceeded Context:**
  - Before the context window is likely to exceed its limit, summarize and commit your progress.
  - Reference previous checkpoint commits to retrieve previous context.
  - Use documentation within TaskManagementPlan.md to note open issues and the next steps.

## 5. Communication Between Sessions
- **Documentation Updates:**
  - Each time you resume work, review the TaskProgress.log and TaskManagementPlan.md to understand the previous session's state.
  - Update the documents with current progress and re-iterate any new issues.
- **Consistent Naming Conventions:**
  - Ensure that every session adheres to a consistent naming convention for commits and branches (e.g., Session-YYYYMMDD-HHMM).
- **Review Meetings (Optional):**
  - Optionally hold a review when resuming work to realign on the overall plan if context was partially lost.

## 6. Tools and Processes
- **Git:**  
  Use Git for all version control tasks. Ensure all changes are committed with descriptive messages.
- **Task Logs:**  
  Maintain a TaskProgress.log file that is updated at the start and end of each session.
- **Documentation:**  
  Keep this document (TaskManagementPlan.md) up-to-date. It serves as the single source of truth for session management.

## 7. Example Commit Message Format
```
Checkpoint [Session 20250214-0915]:
- Forked repository (ADS-BaaS) completed.
- docker-compose.yml updated with new service names.
- .env modifications aligned with AWS SES/S3 integration.
Pending:
- Final integration testing of persistent volumes.
- Further configuration of Auth and Storage services.
