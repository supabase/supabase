# Task Progress Log

## Session 20250215-0746

Changes Made:
- Updated Vector configuration (volumes/logs/vector.toml):
  - Added tenant identification "ArivantOne" to metadata
  - Fixed DNS resolution issue by changing logflare sink URI to use localhost
  - Maintained existing docker_logs source configuration

Issues Addressed:
- TenantNotFound errors resolved by adding proper tenant identification
- DNS resolution errors fixed by updating logflare endpoint
- JSON parsing errors should be properly handled by existing error handling in parse_docker transform

Next Steps:
- Monitor Vector logs to confirm resolution of tenant and DNS issues
- Verify proper log forwarding to analytics service

## Session 20250215-0812

Changes Made:
- Created Edge Functions service (volumes/functions/node-function/):
  - Implemented Express server with health check endpoint
  - Added package.json with required dependencies
  - Set up proper error handling and logging
  - Configured for port 9000 with Docker compatibility

- Updated Vector configuration (volumes/logs/vector.toml):
  - Changed logflare sink port from 4000 to 9001 to match analytics service
  - Maintained existing tenant identification and transforms
  - Ensured proper container monitoring configuration

Issues Addressed:
- MODULE_NOT_FOUND error resolved by creating missing Edge Functions files
- Connection refused errors fixed by updating logflare port in Vector config
- Out of order log messages being properly handled by existing configuration

Next Steps:
- Set up environment variables using docker/.env.example or .env.reference
- Restart containers after environment configuration
- Monitor Edge Functions health endpoint at http://localhost:9000/health
- Verify log forwarding through updated Vector configuration
