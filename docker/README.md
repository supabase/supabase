## Important Notes

### Security

⚠️ **The default configuration is not secure for production use.**

Before deploying to production, you must:
- Update all default passwords and secrets in the `.env` file
- Generate new JWT secrets
- Review and update CORS settings
- Consider setting up a secure proxy in front of self-hosted Supabase
- Review and adjust network security configuration (ACLs, etc.)
- Set up proper backup procedures
