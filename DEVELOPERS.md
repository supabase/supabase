## Development Setup

First off, thanks for your interest in Supabase and for wanting to contribute! before you begin, read the [code of conduct](https://github.com/supabase/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and check out the [existing issues](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/issues). This document describes how to set up your development environment to build and test Supabase.

### Installing Dependencies

Before you can build Supabase, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your
machine:

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/)

* [Node.js v16.x (LTS)](http://nodejs.org)

* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) version 7+.

### Forking Supabase on GitHub

To contribute code to Supabase, you must fork the [Supabase Repository](https://github.com/supabase/supabase). After you fork the repository, you may now begin editing the source code.

## Building Supabase

To build Supabase, you clone the source code repository:

2. Clone your GitHub forked repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/<github_username>/supabase.git
   ```

3. Go to the Supabase directory:
   ```sh
   cd supabase
   ```

### Choosing Directory

Before you start a development server, you must choose if you want to work on the [Supabase Website](https://supabase.com), [Supabase Docs](https://supabase.com/docs/), or [Supabase Studio](https://app.supabase.io).

1. Go to the [Supabase Website](https://supabase.com) directory

    ```sh
    cd web
    ```
    Go to the [Supabase Studio](https://app.supabase.io) directory
    ```sh
    cd studio
    ```

2. Install npm dependencies:

    npm
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

    or with yarn
    ```sh
    yarn install
    ```
